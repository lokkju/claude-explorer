"""Custom Hatch build hook that bundles the React frontend into the wheel.

Behavior:
- Runs ONLY for the `wheel` build target (not sdist, not editable).
- Builds the frontend via `npm ci && npm run build` if `frontend/dist` is
  missing or older than any curated source input.
- Injects `frontend/dist/` into the wheel at `backend/_static/` via
  ``build_data["force_include"]`` so files don't need to be tracked by git
  and the source tree is never polluted.
- Fails loudly with an actionable message if `npm` isn't on PATH.

End users installing from PyPI never see this hook — wheels are pre-built.
