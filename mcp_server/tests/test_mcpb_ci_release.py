"""CI wiring test for the MCPB release flow.

Per ``PLANS/2026.06.04-mcpb-bundle.md`` §"Commit 6 — CI release wiring":

When a ``v*`` tag is pushed, ``.github/workflows/release.yml`` must:

1. Build the MCPB artifact alongside the wheel.
2. Attach ``dist/claude-explorer-*.mcpb`` to the GitHub Release.

If a future PR rips out the build-mcpb job or breaks the artifact upload,
this test fails BEFORE a release tag is pushed — instead of "the
GitHub Release ships without the .mcpb attachment and a user file an
issue."

The test parses the YAML and asserts structural invariants, NOT exact
string matches — so reformatting (re-ordering steps, renaming workers,
bumping action versions) doesn't break it.
