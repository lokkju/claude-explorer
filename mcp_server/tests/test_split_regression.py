"""MCP regression tests for the ConversationListItem split.

These two tests pin the MCP-side public contract that the
``ConversationSummary`` -> ``ConversationListItem`` split MUST NOT
break:

* ``list_sessions`` still includes ``human_message_count`` per session
  (schema-stable in ``mcp_server/SPEC.md``).
* ``export_session`` still receives ``summary`` from the underlying
  ``ConversationDetail`` and threads it through the Markdown export.

NOTE: The plan and the article both originally cited a non-existent
``get_session`` tool here. The real ``summary``-consuming tool is
``export_session`` — see ``mcp_server/server.py`` line ~633 where
``conversation.summary`` is copied into the sliced ``ConversationDetail``
before ``conversation_to_markdown`` runs. Test #8 below targets
``export_session`` accordingly.
