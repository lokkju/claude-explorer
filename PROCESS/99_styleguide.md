# Author Voice Cheat-Sheet

Distilled from Raymond E. Peck III's existing Medium series, *"Best Practices for Modern REST APIs in Python"* (4 parts, published on `levelup.gitconnected.com`), plus the [column intro](https://medium.com/@raymondpeck/column-best-practices-in-modern-python-0cc40b50170e).

**This file is pasted into the prompt of every subagent that drafts article prose.** Mismatch with the voice here is a correctness bug.

---

## Active voice (critical)

**This is the single most load-bearing voice rule in the cheatsheet.** It is on par with the no-em-dash and no-"X, not Y" rules: a draft that nails every other rule but slips into stative or passive constructions will still read as not-mine. When in doubt, the grammatical subject of every sentence should be doing something.

Scan each sentence's main verb. If it's *"is"*, *"was"*, *"are"*, *"were"*, *"be"*, or *"been"*, look for a transitive verb hiding in the predicate that should be promoted.

Five patterns to watch for and rewrite:

1. **Passive voice proper.**
   - ❌ *"The file is saved by the back end."*
   - ✅ *"The back end saves the file."*

2. **Copula-plus-participle ("X is Y made Z").** The main verb is *"is"* and the meaning is carried by a postmodifying participle. Promote the participle to the main verb.
   - ❌ *"The sidebar is the unified corpus made visible."*
   - ✅ *"The sidebar makes the unified corpus visible."*

3. **Hedged copula ("X is what does Z", "X is the kind of Y that does Z").** Replace with the direct active form.
   - ❌ *"The watcher is what protects you from rotation."*
   - ✅ *"The watcher protects you from rotation."*

4. **Stative noun phrases ("there is X", "there are Y").** Find the verb that's actually happening and lead with it.
   - ❌ *"There is a refresh button at the top of the sidebar that triggers a Desktop fetch."*
   - ✅ *"A refresh button at the top of the sidebar triggers a Desktop fetch."*

5. **Verbless / telegraphic fragments (no main verb at all).** Two noun phrases or absolute clauses jammed together as a "sentence" read like status-log shorthand, not prose. Give it a real verb.
   - ❌ *"Install done, first fetch streaming."*
   - ✅ *"The install's done and the first fetch is streaming in."*
   - ❌ *"Beyond that posture, a one-time supply-chain audit and the scans that gate every push:"*
   - ✅ *"Beyond that posture, two things back it up: a one-time supply-chain audit, and the scans that gate every push."*
   - Carve-out: a short verbless tag deliberately closing a sentence or paragraph for rhythm (*"one server for both."*, *"One checkbox, every source."*, *"nothing to clone, nothing to build, just run."*) is a rhetorical beat, not this failure mode. The tell: does it jar (scene-setting or transition shorthand) or land (an emphatic summary)?

Why it matters: the active verb is shorter and clearer; the grammatical subject becomes the semantic actor (so the reader does not have to unwind an equation); repeated *"is"* / *"are"* as main verbs reads as AI-generated drift. The same instinct underlies the "X, not Y" ban below: prefer concrete predication over rhetorical posing.

---

## Pronouns

- **"we"** for the shared journey: *"we'll see how we can…"*, *"let's walk through…"*
- **"I"** for opinions, asides, credits: *"I prefer to keep…"*, *"I commented the heck out of it"*, *"I love it when I get to use the word isomorphic!"*
- **"you"** for direct reader address only: *"you're reading this!"*, *"make sure to go back and read it!"*

## Register

Conversational-technical. Senior engineer leaning across the desk, not lecturing from a podium. Opinionated but warm. Assumes the reader knows Python / web dev but doesn't condescend. Explains *why* before *how*.

## Lede

One sentence, italic-bold, summarizing *this part's* scope. Example (from Part 2):

> ***In this part of the series, we learn about best practices for our API documentation and endpoint definitions, including `async` and clean and correct database session management.***

## Motivate technical detail from the user's perspective first

**This is a top-priority structural rule, on par with active voice.** Whenever a paragraph (or H4, or sub-section) is about to describe HOW something works internally, lead with WHY it matters from the user's perspective. A reader who doesn't yet care about the mechanism won't slow down to absorb it; a reader who's been told what problem the mechanism solves will lean in.

The lead-in doesn't have to be long. One sentence is usually enough, and two is the ceiling. The shape is: *(user-visible problem or user-visible payoff) ... (and here's how it works)*.

- ❌ Cold open into the technical paragraph: *"The implementation tracks one piece of state: the UUID of the message you last clicked or scrolled to. The viewer keeps it in a React ref..."* (the reader has no reason to care yet)
- ✅ Motivation-led: *"Modern apps love to scroll themselves around in the background; a refetch lands, a checkbox flip rebuilds the list, and suddenly you've lost the bubble you were reading. The viewer tracks where you're reading and stays put unless you tell it otherwise. **The implementation tracks one piece of state: the UUID of the message you last clicked or scrolled to...**"* (now the technical detail has a stake)

For the userdoc twin, motivation IS the explanation; the technical detail stays in the long-form twin. The userdoc paragraph should describe the user-visible behavior in plain English and stop. For the long-form twin, motivation leads INTO the technical detail, not instead of it.

Applies equally to code blocks, benchmark tables, and prose deep-dives. A `make bench` table is more interesting with one sentence on what it's good for; a `useEffect` excerpt is more interesting with one sentence on the user pain it eliminates.

## "Previously on…"

Every part after #1 opens with a recap + link to the prior part:

> *"In the previous installation of this series, we covered …"*
> *"If you haven't yet read Part 1 and Part 2, I strongly suggest you do so before tackling this one."*
> *"If you missed that, make sure to go back and read it!"*

## Headers

- **H2** for major sections: `## Documentation`, `## Introspection`, `## Linked Classes`, `## Wrapping Up!`
- **H3** for subsections: `### Guiding Principles`, `### CRUD Class Design`, `### Design Considerations`
- Keep them short and declarative. No gerunds-as-headers unless required.
- **Lead a header with the action, not a nominalization or noun-pile.** A header like *Cold-restart lifespan staggering* (modifier + modifier + gerund-as-noun) forces the reader to unstack a noun pile; put the verb first instead: *Staggering the cold-restart lifespan*. This is the *"required"* case in the rule above. When the only short alternative is a nominalized noun pile (*Truncation disclosure*, *Conversation-detail caching*, *Tool-aware projection*), the active gerund-led form wins (*Disclosing truncation*, *Caching conversation detail*, *Making search tool-aware*). Match the section's own pattern, too: a run of *Caching… / Trimming… / Virtualizing… / Running…* headers should not hide a lone noun-pile among them.

- **Long H2 sections need H3 subheaders.** When an H2 section covers four-plus distinct subtopics, or runs past about eight paragraphs, split it with H3s so a reader skimming can see the section's structure. The article-of-record test: if the H2 section had its own little table of contents, would it have more than one entry? If yes, write the H3s that table of contents would have. A wall of H2-only sections, each covering a feature cluster without internal hierarchy, reads as undifferentiated to a scrolling reader; H3s give them the topic anchors they're after.

## Section openings

When opening a major section (especially *Install / Setup / First Run* sections), lead with the **named product or tool**, not with meta-framing about how to approach it.

- ❌ *"The fastest way to get value out of this project is to treat it like a local tool you can run in an afternoon..."* (meta-framing — tells the reader how to think about the thing before introducing the thing; *"in an afternoon"* also ages badly the moment the install gets faster)
- ✅ *"`claude-explorer` is a local tool you can get running in just a few minutes..."* (direct — the product name in backticks is the first thing the reader sees, and the time-to-value claim is verifiable today)

**Time-to-value claims must reflect the current install.** If you write *"runs in an afternoon"* and the next refactor compresses install to one command, the article reads as stale even though every other fact is true. Either keep the claim ground-truth-current, or drop it and let the bash block speak for itself.

**Early forward-references are cheap insurance.** If a follow-on article in the series will earn its own dedicated teaser at the end of this part, a one-line forward hook in the *body* (often the Install section opener or the introductory paragraph) catches readers who don't scroll all the way through. When the choice is between a voice flourish and an early hook, prefer the hook if the flourish doesn't add product value the hook would.

- ❌ *"We'll keep it boring on purpose; boring is what you want from anything that handles credentials and writes thousands of files onto your machine."* (nice voice aside, but it doesn't move the reader toward the next part of the series)
- ✅ *"We'll leave the MCP server for the next article in the series. It'll let you use the same corpus of Claude conversations to have Claude analyze itself for a bunch of different use cases."* (same prose budget, with a strategic hook the late teaser will then pay off)

The article ends up with a **two-stage tease**: an early hint here, the full setup later. The late teaser feels earned rather than abrupt because the reader has already been primed.

**Implementation-detail sections should be visibly skippable.** The series targets both engineers who want the stack and the algorithm internals, and end users who just want to use the tool. Anything that's *"how it's built"* rather than *"how to use it"* (tech stack credits, performance benchmarks, SQLite schemas, useEffect snippets) belongs under its own H3 subheader, and ideally opens with a one-line skip hint so a non-tech reader can scroll past without parsing it. The H3 + skip-hint combo is especially right for sections labelled *"Tech Stack"*, *"How it works under the hood"*, *"Caching architecture"*, where the reader is making an explicit "tell me more or skip" choice.

- ✅ *"### Tech Stack* — *Skip ahead if the stack doesn't interest you. The back end is FastAPI..."* (the H3 anchors the section, the first sentence tells the user it's optional)
- ❌ Same content as a paragraph mid-section with no H3 and no skip-hint, forcing every reader to wade through it to reach the next product beat.

## Sentence rhythm

- Average 20–30 words.
- Layered subordinate clauses joined by *however*, *on the other hand*, *but also because…*
- Favorite scaffold: **"On one hand… on the other hand…"**
- Punctuated by short enthusiastic one-liners: *"I figured out a way, and you're reading this!"*, *"See you then!"*
- **Tighter joining of related thoughts. Choppy back-to-back short sentences are an AI-writing tell.** Raymond joins related thoughts using one of three tools, in rough order of preference:

  1. **Semicolons** for parallel / contrastive pairs.
     - ❌ *"The UI is how you browse and read. The MCP server is how another Claude reads."*
     - ✅ *"The UI is how you the human search and browse and read; the MCP server is how another Claude session searches and browses and reads."*

  2. **Comma splices** for a tight reframe of a just-said thing (technically "wrong" per strict grammar, intentionally informal in Raymond's voice).
     - ❌ *"You will not find your conversations. They're not there."*
     - ✅ *"You will not find your conversations, they're not there."*

  3. **Subordinating clauses** (*because, since, however, on the other hand, but also because…*) when the thoughts are cause-and-effect or contrast, not reframing.

  When in doubt between a period and one of the above, and the two clauses are thematically paired (contrast, parallel structure, cause/effect, reframing), avoid the period. Periods go between thematic units, not inside them.

- **Prefer technical vocabulary when it fits.** Small but real: Raymond will pick *query* over *ask*, *iterate* over *loop*, *idempotent* over *safe to re-run*, when the more-technical word is accurate. This is not showing off; it's precision. The "I love it when I get to use the word isomorphic!" moment (in Tone tics) is the archetype.

- **First-person active voice beats relative-clause appendages.** When you want to attach a personal connection (your column, your other project, a thing you've written) to a noun you just named, do it in a new sentence with *"I"* rather than as a relative clause hanging off the prior subject. The first-person version is shorter, more direct, and lets the named thing get its own beat.
  - ❌ *"FastAPI is Sebastián Ramírez's work, the same ecosystem I cover in [my best-practices column]."* (the *"I cover"* hangs off Sebastián as a tail clause; two ideas crammed into one sentence)
  - ✅ *"FastAPI is from Sebastián Ramírez. I cover FastAPI in detail in [my best-practices column]."* (two sentences, two subjects, each doing one thing)

- **Active voice is the top-level rule** — see the *"Active voice (critical)"* section near the top of this file. Every other rhythm guideline below assumes you're already drafting in active voice.

- **Compress collaborator credits into naming when you can.** When the credit can ride alongside the introduction of the tool itself, the prose reads tighter than two-clauses-with-restating.
  - ❌ *"The back end is FastAPI; FastAPI is Sebastián Ramírez's work..."* (introduces FastAPI, then re-references it as the subject of the credit clause)
  - ✅ *"The back end is FastAPI from Sebastián Ramírez..."* (the credit is part of the naming itself)

- **`backend` / `frontend` are adjectives; `back end` / `front end` are the noun forms.** Two words when it's the thing itself, one word when it modifies another noun.
  - ✅ Noun (two words): *"The back end is FastAPI."* *"The front end `PATCH`es `/api/preferences`."* *"The back end serves both out of one process."*
  - ✅ Adjective (one word): *"the FTS5 index is built at backend startup"*, *"the local backend proxy"*, *"a backend integration test"*.
  - Code identifiers and on-disk paths (`backend.store`, `frontend/src/foo.ts`, the literal `backend/` directory in the repo) stay as written; they're Python identifiers and POSIX paths, not English nouns.

## Paragraphs

3–5 sentences. Rare two-sentence paragraphs for emphasis.

**Split by subtopic, not by length.** A paragraph carries one beat. When the prose pivots from *"what this is"* to *"how the UI exposes it"*, or from *"the behavior"* to *"the rationale"*, that's the seam — start a new paragraph there, even if neither half would be "too long" on its own. Wall-of-text paragraphs (6+ sentences, or two-plus distinct beats jammed together) read like AI-generated dumps and lose readers who skim. A reader scanning paragraph openings should be able to reconstruct the section's structure.

- ❌ One 7-sentence paragraph covering: *how images are stored on disk → the lightbox keyboard shortcuts → how the local proxy works → how path traversal is prevented*. Four beats, one block.
- ✅ Four paragraphs, one beat each: *(1) on-disk shape and inline thumbnails. (2) lightbox + keyboard. (3) the local proxy and offline behavior. (4) the path-traversal hardening.* A reader who only reads the first sentence of each paragraph still gets the structure.

## Code

- Full blocks (30–60 lines), not snippets.
- **Before** the block: prose that sets up the design problem — *"Let's see how we can define a flexible class hierarchy for our domain objects…"*
- **After** the block: commentary explaining *why* each decision matters — *"The `User` class includes …"*
- Triple-quoted docstrings *inside* the code are used as teaching comments; `#`-comments are sparse.
- In prose, every identifier / path / keyword / CLI flag goes in backticks: `async`, `table=True`, `/docs`, `--proxy-server`.
- **Keyboard shortcuts go in bold backticks, uniformly: `` **`⌘+K`** ``, `` **`Enter`** ``, `` **`u`** ``.** Bold *every* keybinding the same way, whether it's a single character (`` **`j`** ``, `` **`?`** ``), a named key (`` **`Esc`** ``, `` **`Tab`** ``), a modifier combo (`` **`⌘+Shift+G`** ``, `` **`Ctrl+N`** ``), or a bare modifier shown as a key label (`` **`⌘`** ``, `` **`Alt`** ``). Plain backticks alone make single characters nearly invisible mid-sentence, and a mix of bold combos with plain single keys looks inconsistent; bold everything so the reader's eye catches every binding. Do NOT bold code identifiers, paths, flags, or option values, even when they sit right next to a shortcut: `metaKey || ctrlKey`, `frontend/src/...`, and `cleanupPeriodDays` stay plain backticks. The test: is it a key the reader physically presses? Bold it. Is it code or config? Plain.
- Italics for single-word emphasis: *"covered a lot of ground"*, *"This is the *only* place we …"*
- **Shell commands the reader is meant to *execute* go in fenced code blocks, not inline backticks.** Inline backticks are for naming and referring (identifiers, paths, flags, error strings, tool names). The moment the prose is telling the reader to *run* something, the command moves to its own ```bash``` (or ```powershell```) block, even if it's a single line. Code blocks are copy-pasteable as-is (Medium renders a copy button), while inline backticks force the reader to assemble the command out of the surrounding sentence; they also help a scanning reader spot the article's executable surface at a glance.
  - ❌ *"Run `claude-explorer serve --help` for the full set of flags."*
  - ✅ *"For the full set of flags, run:* `bash` *block containing* `claude-explorer serve --help` *."*
  - References stay inline: *"the `--proxy` flag"*, *"the `uv run --directory` form"*, *"every `claude-explorer serve` start kicks off..."* — these are naming the thing, not asking the reader to type it.

## Screenshots and image sizing

Obsidian embeds (`![[Pasted image ....png]]`) render full-width by default; add `|<width>` (e.g. `|450`) to shrink one. The goal is **legibility**: size every screenshot so the smallest text the reader needs stays readable. Use the source image's pixel width as the decider, because it's a direct proxy for how much of the screen you captured (a retina full-window grab lands near ~3600 px; cropping to one modal naturally yields well under ~1400 px). Check it with `sips -g pixelWidth "<file>"`.

- **Source width ≥ ~1500 px → render full-width** (no `|width`). These are whole or near-whole app windows. They stay wide even when a modal or dialog is open inside one, because the surrounding chrome already shrinks the modal's contents and narrowing the whole image would make that text unreadable. (The Manage-filters modal shown in context with the full window, source ~2666 px, is the canonical case: full-width.)
- **Source width < ~1500 px → add a `|width`** so the clip doesn't render "magnified". These are tight crops of a single surface (a cropped modal, overlay, panel, or control: the keyboard-shortcuts overlay ~1028 px, the Settings page ~1348 px, a cropped Search Pane ~776 px). In practice `|400`–`|514` reads well; pick the width that keeps the labels legible without blowing the clip up.
- The ~1500 px line cleanly separates our two real clusters (the widest crop we use is ~1348 px; the narrowest full-window is ~1734 px). Don't narrow a full-window shot just because it happens to contain a modal; the modal's text will go sub-legible.

## Lists vs prose

Prose-dominant. Bulleted lists appear only for enumerating variants (UserBase / UserCreate / UserRead / UserUpdate) or callouts. Numbered lists almost never.

## Tone tics

- Exclamation points used liberally for enthusiasm and section breaks: *"Ok, that's enough for today!"*, *"See you next time!"*
- Occasional nerdy emoji — 🤓 at wrap-up.
- Mild self-deprecation / self-awareness: *"I commented the heck out of it."*, *"I love it when I get to use the word isomorphic!"*
- Credits collaborators and tool authors by name (Sebastián Ramírez etc.).
- **Approved signature phrases — keep these when they appear naturally; do not flag them as clichés.** These are part of Raymond's established voice, not AI-assistant tells:
  - *"As I often say, laziness is the mother of invention!"* — used after any "I let the tool do the work" beat.
  - *"I commented the heck out of it."*
  - *"I love it when I get to use the word isomorphic!"* (or similar nerd-delight asides at vocabulary choices).
  - *"I figured out a way, and you're reading this!"*

## Closing move ("Wrapping Up!")

Every part ends with an **H2 "Wrapping Up!"** (with exclamation). Content:

1. Brief recap of what was covered.
2. Bridge to the next part: *"We'll continue on next time with our flexible search implementation."*
3. Call to comment / clap / follow: *"Like last time, please comment below with any questions, corrections, etc. If you liked this, please clap and follow me here and on LinkedIn."*
4. Sign-off: *"See you next time!"* or *"See you then!"*
5. On the final part only: *"I hope this material and the repo have been helpful! I know that it'll help me remember all the obscure tricks when I need them. 🤓"*

## Ten characteristic sentences (for mimicry)

1. *"Ok, that's enough for today! We covered a lot of ground."*
2. *"We'll continue on next time with our flexible search implementation."*
3. *"Like last time, please comment below with any questions, corrections, etc."*
4. *"If you liked this, please clap and follow me here and on LinkedIn."*
5. *"See you next time!"*
6. *"If you haven't yet read Part 1 and Part 2, I strongly suggest you do so before tackling this one."*
7. *"I figured out a way, and you're reading this!"*
8. *"I commented the heck out of it."*
9. *"I love it when I get to use the word isomorphic!"*
10. *"I hope this material and the repo have been helpful! I know that it'll help me remember all the obscure tricks when I need them. 🤓"*

## Style cheat-sheet (quick reference)

- **Direct and clear is the goal every other rule serves.** When two phrasings are equally correct, pick the more direct, clearer one; when you offer options, lead with the most direct. (*"as one pipeline: find, outline, read, export"* beats *"as the pipeline they form."*)
- **Active voice on every sentence** — scan main verbs; rewrite anything stative or passive. (See *"Active voice (critical)"* above.) Equal weight with the no-em-dash and no-"X, not Y" bans.
- **Motivate technical detail from the user's perspective FIRST.** No cold opens into mechanism. Lead with the user pain or user payoff; the implementation follows. (See *"Motivate technical detail from the user's perspective first"* above.)
- Italic-bold one-line lede. Link to prior part(s). *"If you missed that, make sure to go back and read it!"*
- "we" for the journey, "I" for the opinions and jokes.
- Each section: prose framing → code block → design commentary explaining *why* each decision matters.
- Drop a self-aware aside or mild nerd-joke once per section.
- Close with "Wrapping Up!" → recap → tease next part → clap/comment/LinkedIn CTA → "See you next time!"
- Backticks on every identifier. Italics for emphasis on single words.
- Exclamation points are free; use them.

## Anti-patterns (things to avoid)

- Corporate-blog hedging ("In this article, we will explore the fascinating world of…").
- Bullet-only writing. Prose carries the voice.
- Numbered step-by-step lists for technical ideas — use prose with `1.` / `2.` embedded.
- Overly academic tone. The author is a working engineer, not a professor.
- AI-assistant tells: *"Let's dive in"*, *"In this comprehensive guide"*, *"It's worth noting that…"*, *"Here's the thing"* / *"Here's the problem"* / *"here are three…"* as a meta-framing opener (lead with the problem or the thing itself, not an announcement of it; carve-out: *"Here's the plan:"* leading straight into an actual itemized plan is a fine signpost), emdashes, "It's not this, it's that" and similar framing that's common to AI writing — Raymond doesn't write like that.
- UI-design jargon (*"toast"*, *"modal"*, *"chip"*, *"drawer"*, *"hamburger"*, *"FAB"*, *"kebab"*) needs a plain-English description, not the term on its own. *"A small status popup in the corner"*, not *"a toast"*. PM / designer vocabulary makes engineering readers pause even when they know the word, and many readers don't.
- **No military / martial OR sports metaphors for ordinary engineering work.** This is not the army, and it isn't a game either. *"campaign"* for a stretch of optimization work is the canonical martial offender (use *"work"*, *"effort"*, *"pass"*, *"round"*, or just name the thing: *"the original optimization work"*, not *"the original optimization campaign"*). Same ban on *"war room"*, *"battle"*, *"attack the problem"*, *"in the trenches"*, *"arsenal"*, *"salvo"*, *"frontline"*, *"wage"*, *"troops"*, *"crusade"*, *"deploy" (as a metaphor — software deployment is fine)*. The **sports** family is just as tired and just as banned: *"slam dunk"*, *"home run"* / *"knock it out of the park"*, *"move the goalposts"*, *"ballpark"* (as a rough number — say *"rough estimate"* / *"on the order of"*), *"game plan"*, *"playbook"*, *"full-court press"*, *"punt"* (for defer — say *"defer"* / *"leave for later"*), *"curveball"*, *"the ball's in your court"*, *"touch base"*, *"raise the bar"*, *"par for the course"*, *"kick off"* (as a metaphor — say *"start"* / *"begin"*). Use the plain word instead; even idioms like *"march through the list"* lean martial, so prefer *"list"* / *"walk through"*. Carve-outs: *"war story"* is an established idiom for a debugging-anecdote subsection and stays; a literal sports/military example in domain content is fine. Pick the plain word; the work is engineering, not combat and not a match.
- **Attribute coding mistakes to Claude Code (the assistant), in active voice with Claude Code as the subject — never to the author or the reader.** When you describe a recurring mistake a `CLAUDE.md` / tuning loop / LLM Council exists to catch, the one making it is the coding assistant; the author is the one who keeps *correcting* it. ❌ *"the mistakes I keep repeating"* / *"mine your own mistakes"* → ✅ *"the mistakes Claude Code keeps making."* ❌ passive cover that hides the agent (*"code shipped against an imagined schema"*) → ✅ active, named subject (*"Claude Code wrote code against an imagined schema"*). Inside an example prompt, don't write *"you"* for the mistakes — the reader parses *"you"* as themselves; name Claude (*"find the mistakes Claude keeps making"*). Correctly-attributed phrasings to keep: *"the mistakes I got tired of seeing"* (the author observing), *"the kind of mistake every coding agent makes."*
- **Reconsider *"bucket"* as a metaphor for a group of things.** It reads crude when used loosely (*"treat everything in repo `foo` as a first-class bucket"* → *collection*, *group*, *category*). Use the plain noun instead. Keep *"bucket"* ONLY where it's an established term of art (an *S3 bucket*, a *token bucket*, a *histogram bucket*); there the word is precise and expected. The tell: if you could swap in *collection* / *group* with no loss, it was the loose metaphor, so swap it.
- **No *"landed"* for shipped work, fixes, or measured results.** It's a tired tech-blog verb (a feature *"landed,"* a fix *"landed,"* a metric *"landed at 87 ms"*). Say the plain thing instead: a fix *shipped* / *went in* / *came in alongside X*; an index *was working* / *was in place*; a latency *dropped to* / *came down to* a number. Reserve *land* for its literal meaning (a search hit *lands* on a message, a scroll *lands* on a row). Same instinct as the *"campaign"* ban above: use the direct word, not the blog-cliché one.
- **Never write *"reach for"* / *"reaches for"* / *"reached for"*** in the sense of *choose / use / pick up* (*"Claude reaches for the tool,"* *"I reach for user scope,"* *"reach for the thesaurus"*). It's a worn writer's cliché, banned outright like *"landed."* Say the plain verb instead: *"Claude uses the tool only when you ask,"* *"I pick user scope,"* *"I use the more technical word."* The literal *reach* stays fine: a search hit *reaches* a row, an argument *reaches* an answer.
- **Reserve *"ship"* / *"shipped"* for things that actually reached users or a release.** Dev-time code, prototypes, refactors, and bugs caught before release never shipped, so don't describe them that way. Say *"wrote,"* *"committed,"* or *"ran,"* and a bug that never reaches anyone is *"waiting to happen,"* not *"waiting to ship."* Sibling to the no-*"landed"* rule above.
- **No *"honest"* / *"honestly"* / *"the most honest way"* as a meta-label on your own prose.** It's a top LLM tell, and worse, flagging one passage as *"honest"* quietly implies the rest isn't. Say the thing plainly, or use a precise word: *the real story*, *to be straight*, *upfront*, *the actual shape*, *accurate*. ❌ *"The most honest way to introduce this is…"* → ✅ *"The best way to introduce this is…"*. ❌ *"Two more bits of honesty…"* → ✅ *"Two more caveats…"*. ❌ *"I'll be honest about what I haven't done"* → ✅ *"I'll be upfront about what I haven't done"*. Carve-out: describing a *person's* actual honesty as a character trait is fine; the ban is *"honest"* as a label for your own writing.
- **Don't lean on sincerity / emphasis intensifiers as filler** — *actually*, *genuinely*, *really*, *truly*, *literally*, *the very* / *this very*. Same family as the *"honest"* tell above: LLMs sprinkle them to sound earnest, and they stack up fast (one Part 3 draft used *"actually"* 16 times and *"genuinely"* 5). Keep one only where it carries a real contrast (*what I **actually** did* vs what the tool merely enables); cut it when the sentence means the same without it. ❌ *"the prompt this **very** server grew from"* → ✅ *"the prompt this server grew from"*. ❌ *"I'd **genuinely** love to hear"* → ✅ *"I'd love to hear"*. ❌ *"the snapshot I **actually** worked from"* → ✅ *"the snapshot I worked from"*. **Be especially suspicious of a bare *"very"*** (*"very first"*, *"very fast"*, *"the very session"*): it isn't banned outright, but it almost never earns its place (*"the **very first** real thing it ever did"* → *"the first real thing it ever did"*; *"this **very** series"* → *"this series"*). Whenever you type *"very"*, stop and check whether the sentence loses anything without it; it usually doesn't. Carve-out: keep *"very"* only where it draws a genuine contrast the sentence needs (*"the **very** session that built it"*, naming the exact one, in the ouroboros image alt).
- **Casual and conversational, never twee or precious.** Raymond's voice is warm and informal (contractions, asides, enthusiasm, a dry joke now and then), but it never strains for cuteness that calls attention to itself. The tell: a phrase that makes the *writer* look clever or charming instead of serving the point. Watch for **cutesy personification** (a tool, a bug, or a data glitch dressed up as a little character), **precious diminutives**, and **forced whimsy**. ❌ *"That little wart told me more than a clean demo ever could"* (a mis-grouped session dressed up as a cute mascot) → ✅ *"A clean demo could never have shown me this."* Carve-out: **dry / wry wit stays** — a bug that *"cheerfully reported '0 msgs'"* or a server that's *"deliberately boring"* is ironic, not cute, because it lands a real point; and the approved signature phrases (*"I commented the heck out of it"*, *"laziness is the mother of invention!"*) are established voice, not twee. The test: would you say it out loud to a senior colleague without wincing? Keep the warmth, cut the performance.
- **Match the verb to the unit when quoting a metric change.** A *×N factor* is a speedup or a multiplier, so it goes up; an *absolute value* (ms, bytes, seconds) is what drops. Don't say a thing *"dropped 57×"* — it *"sped up ~57×"* (or *"got ~57× faster"*). Reserve *dropped / fell / shrank* for the absolute numbers: *"latency dropped from 1,474 ms to 230 ms"*, *"the payload shrank from 650 KB to 459 KB"*. Mixing the two (*"dropped 57×"*) reads as a unit error to any numerate reader. Also keep the **×-factor honest against the stated before/after**: if the table says 4.5 s → 87 ms, the prose says ~52×, not a rounder-sounding 57× from some other baseline; recompute rather than eyeball.
- *"Mode"* implies a sticky, persistent state the user switches into and stays in. Reserve it for settings that behave that way (Light / Dark / System theme, Emacs / Vim keybindings). For a one-off, per-action choice, name the choice: quoting a search query is a per-query decision (quotes or no quotes), so *"two modes you'll use day-to-day"* mislabels it. Same caution for *"toggle"* / *"switch"* / *"state"* when the thing is really a single decision: the word sets the reader's mental model, so pick one that matches the behavior.
  - Even when the state genuinely IS sticky, prefer a precise domain noun over the generic *"mode"* if one exists. The search **pin** survives panel close and a full page reload, so it clears the stickiness bar, yet it's a search *scope*, and the article already uses "scope" everywhere else. So *"a complementary mode"* → *"a complementary scope"*, *"makes a mode visible"* → *"makes the active scope visible"*, *"the same scoped mode"* → *"scoped the same way"*. *"Mode"* is the fallback you use only when no sharper noun (scope, filter, theme, layout) fits; a sharper noun tells the reader *what kind* of state it is, where "mode" only tells them *that* there is one.

### The "it's not X, it's Y" trope — one-shot example (do not use this construction)

This construction is a top-3 AI-writing tell. Avoid it even when the contrast feels natural. **Just state what it is; drop the negation.**

- ❌ *"The real payoff isn't neatness, it's **learning across silos**."*
- ✅ *"The real payoff is **learning across silos**."*

Other surface forms to avoid with the same fix:

- *"Not X. Y."* (two sentences)
- *"It's less about X and more about Y."*
- *"X is fine, but Y is the point."*

If you genuinely need to negate a prior framing (because the reader is mid-paragraph and needs to unlearn something), just say *"I don't mean X"* once and move on. Don't build paragraphs on the contrast.

## Revision passes (run every scan on every draft)

A draft that reads fine on the first pass still hides these. Run the scans below as **separate passes** — each hunts one failure mode, and trying to catch them all in one read misses most of them. Most map to a rule above; the scan is the discipline of actually looking. Run them on **both twins**, and keep shared surfaces (image alt text, attribution, cross-links, every factual claim) parallel between them. Earned across the Part 3 review (2026-06-03), where each pass turned up something the previous passes had read straight past.

A scan that comes back clean is a real result worth reporting — don't invent problems to look thorough, and don't soften or delete a true claim just to satisfy a pass (see *"Active voice"* note on precision-bearing qualifiers).

1. **AI tells.** Em-dashes; *"X, not Y"*; *"Here's the thing/problem"*; *"It's worth noting"*; *"honest"/"honestly"* as a self-label; sincerity intensifiers (*actually / genuinely / really / the very*). → Anti-patterns.
2. **Flat or clunky sentences.** Read each sentence *whole*, not word-by-word: limp copulas, dangling clauses, noun-piles, garden-paths. The tell is "correct but no music" (8th-grade drift). Rewrite at the sentence level — never token-swap inside an already-broken frame, which is how a strained clause collapses into nonsense.
3. **Twee / cutesy.** Cute personification, precious diminutives, forced whimsy (the *"little wart"*). Keep dry wit; cut performance. → Anti-patterns.
4. **Clichés / stock phrases.** Tired idioms, and especially any stock phrase used **twice** (*"earns its keep"* ×3, *"baked into"* ×2, *"hard-won"*). Vary or cut. → the *reach-for / landed / bucket / martial+sports* bans.
5. **Passive voice.** Scan every *is/are/was/were/be/been* for a hidden transitive; promote the agent. Carve-outs: legal boilerplate, verbatim quotes, predicate-adjective states (*"the dogfooding was front-loaded"*). → *"Active voice (critical)."*
6. **Wordiness / redundancy.** *"in order to"* → *"to"*; doubled appositives; a point already made a paragraph earlier; two words doing one word's work.
7. **Jargon a non-expert trips on.** Userdoc twin: **zero** unexplained jargon — gloss it (*"context window"* → *"the space it has left to think"*) or cut it, and link any prerequisite install. Long-form twin: only terms the deep-dive reader actually needs; define on first use.
8. **Sentence rhythm.** Vary length; land a short punch after a long build; avoid runs of same-length sentences, and make sibling paragraphs end in parallel (both on a short line, not one punchy and one trailing). → *"Sentence rhythm."*
9. **Hedges / weak qualifiers.** Cut filler *somewhat / fairly / a bit / kind of / I think*; keep only qualifiers carrying real precision (*"usually,"* when it's genuinely usually-not-always). Never hedge a true claim.
10. **Vague filler nouns/verbs.** *things / stuff / various / useful / good / a good one* → name the concrete thing.
11. **Number & fact consistency.** Cross-check every figure against the others and the real data (the *"25,689 messages"* vs *"twenty-thousand-message"* miss); round consistently across the piece.
12. **Terminology & formatting consistency.** *back end / front end* (nouns) vs *backend / frontend* (adjectives); product names; every identifier / path / flag in backticks; keyboard keys in bold backticks; **H2 Title Case / H3 sentence case**; a run of gerund-led headers stays gerund-led.
13. **Word over-repetition.** Grep distinctive words you've leaned on (*deliberate / exactly / outline-first*) and vary the ones that aren't load-bearing concepts.
14. **Motivate from the user's perspective.** Every section or paragraph about to explain mechanism leads with the user pain or payoff first. → *"Motivate technical detail from the user's perspective first."*
