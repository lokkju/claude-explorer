"""F5 council finding: the post-capture banner echoed session_key[:20].

Two call sites previously printed the first 20 characters of the
Anthropic session key to the user's terminal:

* ``cli/main.py:_capture_via_browser`` (formerly ``fetcher/cli.py:274``)
* ``fetcher/playwright_capture.py:408`` — standalone CLI banner

Anthropic session keys begin with the fixed prefix ``sk-ant-sid01-``
(13 chars), so 20 chars exposed exactly 7 chars of secret entropy.
While not enough for direct replay, this still leaked bearer-token
material into:

* terminal scrollback,
* screen recordings / screenshots,
* CI logs (if anyone runs capture in CI),
* shell history exports,
* support pastebins.

The council judged this HIGH for V1-public ship. Fix: drop the
session-key line entirely. The user still gets non-secret
confirmation (saved-path, org-id summary) so the UX isn't worse.
