"""Tests for ``fetcher.bulk_fetch.load_credentials`` — the legacy
credentials reader used by the CLI's `claude-explorer fetch` entry point.

Pre-fix bug (Hunt #2 — unsafe structured-parse exceptions):
    A user who hand-edits ``~/.claude-explorer/credentials.json`` and breaks
    the JSON (truncated, missing quote, control character) hits an
    unhandled ``json.JSONDecodeError`` when running ``claude-explorer
    fetch``. The CLI surfaces a raw Python stack trace instead of an
    actionable ClickException with recovery copy.

Bidirectional discipline:

  * RED ``test_load_credentials_corrupt_json_raises_clean_clickexception``:
    pre-fix this raises ``JSONDecodeError`` (stack trace to user); post-fix
    it raises ``click.ClickException`` with a recovery message.
  * GREEN pair ``test_load_credentials_valid_json_returns_dict``: a normal
    JSON file still returns its dict unchanged.
  * GREEN pair ``test_load_credentials_missing_file_raises_clean_clickexception``:
    the original missing-file gate still fires (not regressed by the new
    guard).
  * Boundary ``test_load_credentials_empty_file_raises_clean_clickexception``:
    empty file is JSON-invalid; must surface as ClickException not as a
    raw parse exception.
  * Boundary ``test_load_credentials_list_root_returns_unchanged_or_raises_clean``:
    a JSON file whose root is a list (e.g. ``[1,2,3]``) is technically
    parseable. The legacy code returned it unchanged (and downstream
    ``.get()`` failed later); we accept either:
      (a) post-fix returns it unchanged for backward compatibility, OR
      (b) post-fix raises ClickException naming the type mismatch.
    We pin (a) because the legacy contract is "return what the file
    contains" and rewriting that semantics is a contract-shape change
    outside the scope of THIS fix. The canonical reader in
    `fetcher/credentials.py` is the place for strict schema validation.
