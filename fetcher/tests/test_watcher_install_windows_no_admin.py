"""Regression test for v1.0.9: `claude-explorer install-watcher` on Windows
MUST register the scheduled task WITHOUT requiring elevation.

Pre-fix bug (v1.0.7 / v1.0.8):
    ``cli/watcher.py:_install_windows`` passed ``/RL HIGHEST`` to
    ``schtasks /Create``. That flag tells Task Scheduler to run the
    registered task with the highest privileges available to the user.
    BUT — ``schtasks /Create`` with ``/RL HIGHEST`` requires elevation to
    register. Non-admin PowerShell sessions fail with
    ``ERROR: Access is denied``. Discovered during cross-platform
    install verification on Windows 11 ARM64 (Phase C2-W, 2026-06-13).

    The watcher only touches user-owned files
    (``~\\.claude-explorer\\``, the CC image cache under ``~\\.claude\\``).
    It does NOT need elevation. ``/RL HIGHEST`` was a copy-paste from
    a more security-restrictive template that doesn't apply here.

The fix drops ``/RL HIGHEST``; the task registers at default user
run-level, which is sufficient for the file copies the watcher does.
This test pins that contract: any future PR that re-adds ``/RL HIGHEST``
(or any other admin-requiring flag) fails this test.

The test runs on all platforms (not Windows-only) because we mock
out subprocess.run + the launcher write; the test exercises only the
command-shape contract, which is platform-independent code.
