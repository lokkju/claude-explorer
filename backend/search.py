"""Full-text search implementation.

Two paths:
  * **FTS5 fast path** (preferred). When :mod:`backend.search_index` reports
    the index is ready and FTS5 is available, queries hit the SQLite FTS5
    inverted index. The index returns ``(conv_uuid, message_uuid)`` pairs;
    we then walk only those conversations from the cache and run the same
    snippet/sort code as the linear path. Latency target: <50 ms per query.
  * **Linear-scan fallback**. When the index isn't ready (initial build
    still in progress), FTS5 isn't compiled into the local sqlite3 build,
    or any sqlite3 error fires, we fall back to the original full-walk
    code path. Search never goes "down".

The two paths produce byte-for-byte identical ``SearchResult`` objects for
whole-word queries (the common case). Sub-string queries that don't align
with token boundaries (e.g., ``"py"`` matching the substring inside
``"happy"``) are a documented behavior change: the FTS5 path returns
prefix-matches only.

      * Token mode: ``(None, ["foo", "bar", "baz"])`` when the query is

    The phrase detection is intentionally narrow (entire query quoted, no

def _build_compact_trigger_uuid_map(conv: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Map each ``/compact`` trigger row's UUID to its compact-marker UUID.

    Background: a manual ``/compact`` produces TWO related user messages in
    ``conv['chat_messages']``: the synthetic ``isCompactSummary: True`` row
    (the LLM's compaction summary, represented in ``conv['compact_markers']``
    as ``{message_uuid, summary_text, kind: 'manual', user_prompt, ...}``)
    and a SECOND user row carrying the ``<command-name>/compact</command-name>``
    envelope plus the verbatim user prompt inside ``<command-args>``. The
    trigger row's UUID is what FTS5 returns when the user searches for
    text from their own prompt (pre-v11 indexing exposed the trigger
    row's body to the index). The frontend's compact-marker auto-expand
    chain keys on the marker's UUID, not the trigger's — so a search hit
    on the trigger UUID prevents the marker from auto-expanding.

    This helper builds the trigger→marker mapping the scatter-gather
    body-emit code uses to REWRITE any latent trigger-row hits into the
    correct marker UUID. Belt-and-suspenders for two drift modes:

      * the SQLite FTS5 index hasn't completed the v10→v11 rebuild yet
        (so it still carries stale trigger-row body tokens); and
      * the linear-scan fallback path, which inherits the index-time
        exclusion via ``_extract_searchable_text`` BUT still benefits
        from rewrite if a future code path re-introduces trigger-row
        text into search without bumping SCHEMA_VERSION.

    Algorithm: for each marker in ``conv['compact_markers']``, locate the
    marker's row in ``chat_messages`` by message_uuid; then scan forward
    up to :data:`_COMPACT_TRIGGER_LOOKAHEAD` messages looking for the
    trigger row (identified by :func:`_is_compact_trigger_message`). The
    scan window matches
    :data:`backend.cc_image_markers._COMPACT_LOOKAHEAD` exactly — the
    same window that pass uses to classify a marker as ``manual``. If
    no trigger is found in window, the marker is auto-compact (no
    user prompt to map). Silent skip rather than crash or guess.

    Returns ``{}`` for conversations with no compact markers (the common
    case — Desktop conversations and most CC sessions). The helper is
    pure-functional and does NOT mutate the input conversation.

    Idempotency: callers apply ``trigger_to_marker.get(uuid, uuid)`` at
    emit sites. The values in the returned dict are NEVER themselves
    keys (a marker UUID cannot also be a trigger UUID — different
    JSONL rows, distinct UUIDs), so multiple applications of the
    mapping are safe.

    byte-for-byte identical ``SearchResult`` objects for whole-word
    queries.

    Scope filters (manual finding 2026-05-04 + sidebar-scope propagation
    2026-05-14):
      - ``conversation_uuid``: restrict to a single conversation. Most
        specific filter; wins over ``project_path`` / ``bookmarks`` /
        ``conversation_uuids`` when more than one is passed.
      - ``project_path``: restrict to conversations whose project_path
        matches exactly (CC sessions grouped by their cwd).
      - ``bookmarks``: restrict to a set of conversation UUIDs (the
        client passes the bookmark set when the sidebar's Starred filter
        is active).
      - ``organization_id`` (sidebar Workspace dropdown, 2026-05-14):
        restrict to conversations whose organization_id matches exactly.
        ``None`` matches only None on the conv side — a UUID filter never
        incidentally surfaces untagged data (mirrors
        ``ConversationStore.list_conversations``).
      - ``conversation_uuids`` (active-filter set, 2026-05-14): restrict
        to a set of UUIDs. The frontend computes this from the active
        filter graph (atoms/groups under
        ``frontend/src/lib/filterEngine.ts``); MCP does not use this.
        ``None`` means "no constraint"; the empty set means "filter
        excludes everything" — caller short-circuits to ``[]``.

    All filters AND-compose with each other and with the existing
    ``source`` filter. Backend-side because tool_use / tool_result
    payloads are large; client-side post-filtering would waste bandwidth
    and break ranking.

    ``include_tool_calls`` (2026-05-11): when False, search ignores
    tool_use / tool_result / thinking content. Hit messages whose only
    matching text lives in those blocks are silently dropped — the
    sidebar should only show results the user can navigate to. The FTS5
    index itself is still built over the full text; the filter is applied
    at scatter/snippet time so toggling the setting doesn't require a
    rebuild.

    ``include_compactions`` (2026-05-26): when False, search ignores
    hits whose match falls inside an ``isCompactSummary`` row body. This
    is the wire-side mirror of the "Show Compactions" checkbox in the
    conversation header. Architecturally identical to
    ``include_tool_calls=False`` but keyed on a per-row boolean column
    (``is_compaction_summary``) populated at index time from
    ``conv['compact_markers']``. The SQL ``WHERE is_compaction_summary
    = 0`` clause applies BEFORE bm25 ranking and LIMIT, so the
    truncation envelope's ``total_messages_matched`` is accurate
    (Council 2026-05-26 chose this over scatter-time post-filter to
    avoid empty-result-set under LIMIT when top-bm25 hits cluster in
    compaction-summary bodies).

    Note on FTS5 ``LIMIT 5000`` and ``include_tool_calls=False``: if a
    user's corpus has more than 5000 messages whose only token-match is
    in tool content, FTS5 may return them as the top 5000 ranked hits
    (we then drop all of them) while a plain-text match further down the
    ranking gets missed. The linear-scan fallback would still find it.
    This is an accepted theoretical drift; on Ray's 1,222-file corpus
    it's unrealizable. If a bug report ever shows count mismatch on a
    real query, pagination is the fix.

        match_start = match_end = 0.
      * Multiple marks: each becomes its own fragment.
      * Empty unmarked spans between consecutive marks: skipped
        so the fragment list never has zero-length entries (the
        invariant the frontend renderer relies on).
      * Malformed input (an open without a close): the trailing
        text after the dangling open is treated as unmarked; we
        never raise on a producer drift bug — falling back to
        "no highlight" is preferable to a 500.

    Replaces the scatter-gather walk in :func:`_search_via_index` with
    two SQL queries:

      1. ``SearchIndex.query_with_snippets`` — body MATCH + FTS5
         ``snippet()`` per row + conv-level metadata (title,
         timestamps, project_path).
      2. ``SearchIndex.title_match_snippets`` — LIKE-based title
         substring sweep that also returns conv-level metadata so
         title-only hits build SearchResult without a body row.

    Zero conversation-file reads. Zero corpus walk. Latency target:
    <200 ms cold / <50 ms warm on the user's 991-conv corpus
    (PLANS/PERFORMANCE_PHASE_2.md §Workstream A measured payoff).

    The output shape matches the legacy path's ``SearchResult`` /
    ``MessageSnippet`` shape with an additional ``fragments`` field
    populated on each body-match row. The legacy ``snippet`` /
    ``match_start`` / ``match_end`` fields stay populated (derived
    from the same fragments) so clients that don't consume
    fragments continue working.

    ``include_tool_calls=False`` (2026-05-16, SEARCH_TOOL_AWARENESS
    plan §A): plumbed all the way down to ``query_with_snippets`` so
    the FTS5 MATCH targets the ``body_text`` column instead of
    ``body``. body_text excludes tool_use / tool_result, so a hit
    whose only token lives in a hidden tool block is dropped at
    MATCH time — exact parity with the linear-scan path's runtime
    filter, but without the corpus walk. Replaces the prior
    accepted-residual divergence (Phase-2 Workstream A).

    # ~5-10s — that's the inherent cost of the slow path because it

    so both paths share the implementation byte-for-byte.

    Bug B fix (V1 polish 2026-05-14, second attempt): for sort fields
    ``updated_at`` and ``created_at``, the conversation-level sort key
    is ``r.conversation_updated_at`` / ``r.conversation_created_at``
    EXACTLY — no max/min over matched-message timestamps.

    Why we removed the prior message-aware sort:

      * The UI displays the conversation's own ``updated_at`` in the
        date column of each result card (frontend SearchPanel.tsx
        renders ``match.createdAt`` first, then falls back to the
        conversation timestamp). The sort label in the same panel is
        "Last Activity" — users reasonably read that as conversation
        activity, not "newest matched message time".
      * The prior key ``max([m.created_at for m in matching_messages])``
        produced a user-visible inversion: a conversation updated
        yesterday whose matched message body is a month old would sort
        BELOW a conversation updated last week with a recent matched
        message. The user sees "yesterday" labeled card BELOW "last
        week" labeled card. Live reproduced 2026-05-14:
          curl /api/search?q=comprehensive+medium&sort=updated_at&sort_order=desc
        showed position 4 with conv_updated_at=2026-05-14 BELOW position 3
        with conv_updated_at=2026-05-01.

    Within-conversation message ordering is unchanged: messages inside
    a single result card group are still sorted by their per-message
    ``created_at`` (with fallback to conversation_updated_at for nulls),
    so multiple matches inside the same conversation show in time order.
