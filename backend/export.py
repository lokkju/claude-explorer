"""Export functionality for Markdown and PDF.

Backwards-compatibility facade for ``backend.exporters.*`` (Council A2
2026-05-21). The Markdown / PDF / bundle surfaces and their shared
helpers live in:

  * ``backend.exporters._shared``  — visibility helpers + dialect +
                                     placeholder filtering + on-disk
                                     attachment resolution
  * ``backend.exporters.markdown`` — ``conversation_to_markdown``,
                                     ``create_markdown_zip``, etc.
  * ``backend.exporters.pdf``      — ``create_pdf``, ``conversation_to_html``,
                                     WeasyPrint url_fetcher, image resolvers
  * ``backend.exporters.bundle``   — ``create_markdown_bundle`` and
                                     its bundle-side helpers

This module re-exports every name the previous monolith exposed so
existing imports continue to work byte-for-byte:

  * ``from backend.export import X``                     (tests)
  * ``from ..export import X``                           (router)
  * monkeypatch targets on ``backend.routers.export.X``  (unchanged —
    the router's value-bound names live there, not here)

Prefer importing directly from the submodules for new code.
