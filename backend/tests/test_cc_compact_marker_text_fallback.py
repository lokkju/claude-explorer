"""Pin the CC compact-marker text-prefix fallback contract.

Bug observed live 2026-05-26: a Claude Code session from Aug 2025
(conv ``da9eec3e-20f1-4007-829a-1af242265ebd``) has the canonical
Claude compaction-prompt text as its first user message body, but
the older CC binary that wrote that session did NOT stamp
``isCompactSummary: true`` on the entry. Result:

* ``extract_compact_markers`` returns []
* conv's ``compact_markers`` field is empty
* frontend's ``hasCompactMarkers`` is False
* the 'Show Compactions' checkbox does not render

Same problem Cowork hit (commit `96e6b2d`), same fix shape: add a
text-prefix fallback for the canonical Claude compaction prompt.
``isCompactSummary: true`` still wins when present (newer CC
sessions); the text-prefix is a defense for legacy entries.

This file pins the contract using the shared
``is_compaction_prefix_text`` helper from ``backend.compact_prefixes``
(introduced in commit `fdbbe4c`), so the CC detector and the
Cowork detector and the FTS title-leak gate ALL agree on what
counts as a compaction.
