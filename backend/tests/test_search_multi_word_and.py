"""Multi-word search semantics (V1 polish, 2026-05-14).

Pins the contract introduced when fixing the right-sidebar search bug
where typing `comprehensive medium article` returned conversations whose
messages did NOT contain all three words. The new contract:

  * **Unquoted multi-word** queries are AND-of-tokens. Every token must
    appear in the matched message body (or title, conservative substring
    behavior preserved).
  * **Quoted multi-word** queries (`"foo bar baz"`) are exact-phrase.
    FTS5 phrase syntax + the same literal-substring snippet regex.
  * **Single token** queries behave exactly as before.

Bidirectional verification: each test was first run against the
pre-fix code path (snippet regex = ``re.escape(query)``) to confirm it
fails with an informative diff, then against the post-fix code path.

Out-of-scope (documented):
  * Title-level AND of tokens — current behavior is full-query substring
    against the title, which is conservative for multi-word queries.
    Tracked in the workflow's "decision_record" residual risks.
