"""V1 polish cleanup (2026-05-13): the search projection MUST exclude
argless command markers (``is_command_marker=True``), matching the
viewer's hidden-by-default behavior and the export surfaces' exclusion
in ``backend.export._is_excludable_marker``.

Spec invariant "one truth, three surfaces" (viewer + search + export):
typing ``exit`` in the search box should NOT produce noisy hits on
``Session: /exit`` chrome rows. If the viewer hides a bubble behind
``SessionPreludeAffordance`` / ``SlashCommandBadge`` and the export
drops it from Markdown/PDF, then a search hit on it would navigate the
user to invisible chrome — exactly the failure mode we want to prevent.

Bidirectional contract:

  * NEGATIVE (the new behavior — these tests):
      - argless ``/exit`` marker  -> projection is ``""``
      - argless ``/clear`` marker -> projection is ``""``
      - prelude marker (which is always argless) -> projection is ``""``
      - exclusion holds in BOTH projection variants
        (include_tool_calls=True AND False)

  * POSITIVE (the inverse — pre-existing behavior must still work):
      - argful ``/coding <prose>`` marker (is_command_marker=False)
        IS searchable; both the user's prose AND the ``/coding``
        token appear in the projection.
      - argful ``/plan <prose>`` marker IS searchable on the prose body.
      - regular user message whose body contains the literal substring
        ``/exit`` somewhere (is_command_marker=False) IS searchable.
      - regular assistant reply IS searchable.

  * INDEX-LEVEL VERIFICATION:
      - The FTS5 indexer (``upsert_conversation``) writes an empty
        ``body`` for argless-marker rows, so an FTS5 ``MATCH`` on
        ``exit`` returns 0 rows for a conversation whose only "exit"
        content lives inside a ``Session: /exit`` argless marker.
      - Bidirectional inverse at the index level: the SAME conversation
        with the marker replaced by a regular user message containing
        ``"please exit the program"`` DOES return a body-match row.
