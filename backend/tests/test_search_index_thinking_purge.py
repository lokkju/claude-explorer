"""Functional pin for the v3 SCHEMA_VERSION thinking-purge contract.

Context (V1 polish 2026-05-13): :func:`backend.search._extract_searchable_text`
stopped indexing ``thinking`` content blocks because the frontend has no
``case 'thinking':`` renderer in V1, so indexed thinking content produced
search "ghosts" — hits whose bubble shows nothing matching. The
companion :data:`backend.search_index.SCHEMA_VERSION` was bumped 2 → 3
to force a one-time drop+rebuild on next process startup so stale
thinking-only matches don't poison FTS5 top-N ranking.

What was already pinned (`test_search_index.py`):
  * ``test_schema_version_mismatch_triggers_full_rebuild`` — the
    *abstract* upgrade contract: bumping ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` wipes all
    rows on next open.

What was MISSING and is pinned here (Bug 2, council-found 2026-05-14):
  * The *functional* contract: against the CURRENT v3 code, a token
    that lives only inside a ``thinking`` block does NOT appear in the
    FTS5 index, while a token that lives in a normal ``text`` block
    DOES. Without this test, a future refactor could re-introduce
    thinking indexing (and remember to bump SCHEMA_VERSION) and the
    schema-rebuild test would still pass even though the functional
    contract regressed.

Test strategy — "no v2 seeding" (DS/ML + Python Expert agreed in
council 2026-05-14):
  * Reason: the upgrade-path mechanism is orthogonal to the projection
    logic, and is already covered by the schema-version test. The gap
    is whether the v3 :func:`_extract_searchable_text` itself respects
    the purge.
  * Approach: build a fresh v3 index against a fixture that
    deliberately keeps the thinking-only token OUT of
    ``message["text"]`` (which is always indexed regardless of block
    type), and only inside a ``{"type": "thinking", "text": "..."}``
    content block. Query both tokens; assert thinking returns 0 hits
    and text returns ≥1 hit with the expected ``message_uuid`` (the
    ``message_uuid`` assertion is diagnostic — if the fixture grows
    later, a stray hit elsewhere wouldn't silently pass the count
    assertion).
