"""Regression: when the client disconnects mid-search, the server
must stop wasting CPU within ~200ms.

User reported (2026-05-22) that fast keystrokes generate multiple
in-flight /api/search requests. The frontend's `cancelQueries` aborts
the client-side fetch, but pre-fix the backend kept running the
abandoned search to completion (~3-13s of wasted CPU and a held
threadpool slot).

User-observable contract (per CLAUDE-TESTING §5.13):
  - After a client disconnect, the request-timing log MUST show an
    elapsed time well below the slow-search budget. We aim for
    <300ms on a search that would normally take >1s to complete.
  - The route MUST NOT emit normal 2xx logging for the abandoned
    work — it returned to the (gone) client early.

Implementation strategy this test pins:
  - Race the search work (offloaded via asyncio.to_thread) against a
    disconnect watcher that polls request.is_disconnected().
  - On disconnect, raise HTTPException(499) so the request lifecycle
    closes promptly and the timing-middleware log line records the
    actual abandoned duration (not the full search time).

NOT pinned (deliberately deferred):
  - sqlite3.Connection.interrupt() to ACTUALLY stop the SQL query
    underneath. The to_thread worker continues running until the
    sync search returns naturally. This is bounded backend CPU
    waste — acceptable for V1 ship, revisitable if telemetry shows
    threadpool pressure.
