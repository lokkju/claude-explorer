"""Drift-first scan tests (PLANS/SEARCH_INDEX_FRESHNESS.md).

Pins the new ``_drift_first_scan`` helper plus the refactored
``build_full_index`` / ``update_drifted_files`` that wrap it.

The contract:
  * Enumerate every on-disk conversation path (Desktop + CC) via
    the existing path-discovery helpers. NO content load.
  * Compare against ``indexed_files`` rows (path + mtime). Diff
    yields ``(drifted_paths, missing_paths)``.
  * Load conversation content ONLY for drifted paths.
  * Cleanup pass deletes ``indexed_files`` rows whose paths have
    vanished from disk.

Performance win: warm restart with zero drift goes from ~10 s
(today's ``get_all_conversations_raw`` walk) to ~100-300 ms
(stat-only). First install is unchanged: every path is "drifted"
so every file gets loaded once anyway.

Correctness invariant pinned by test 6: ``mark_ready()`` only fires
AFTER the drift set has been absorbed. Otherwise a stale FTS5 row
could be served between the version bump and the rebuild finishing,
silently breaking the "update session, restart, ⌘+K finds it" use
case.
