"""Pin the v14 migration's self-repair contract.

Bug observed live 2026-05-26 on rpeck's machine: ``schema_version=14``
was stamped against a ``conversations`` table that still had the v13
column set (no ``is_compaction_titled``). Subsequent ``upsert_conversation``
calls would crash on the first INSERT into the missing column.

Root cause: ``SearchIndex._init_schema``'s early-return gate at
``cols_ok and version_ok`` only checks the ``messages`` columns, not
``conversations``. When a partial prior migration (uvicorn --reload
racing the supervised watcher) stamps the version without finishing
the ALTER, the early-return path skips the repair.

This file pins: on next open with v14 code, a database in the
hybrid-broken state (schema_version=14 + missing
conversations.is_compaction_titled) MUST self-repair (add the
column + backfill) rather than silently early-return.
