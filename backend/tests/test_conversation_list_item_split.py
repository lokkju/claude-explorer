"""Tests for the ConversationListItem / ConversationSummary split.

These tests pin the public contract of the
``/api/conversations`` list endpoint after PLANS/SPLIT_CONVERSATION_SCHEMA.md:

* The list endpoint serializes the SKINNY ``ConversationListItem`` shape:
  ``summary``, ``human_message_count``, and ``git_branch`` are stripped
  from each row to shrink the wire payload.
* The per-conversation endpoint (``/api/conversations/{uuid}``) still
  serializes the FULL ``ConversationDetail`` shape and continues to
  include ``git_branch`` (read by the detail-page Details disclosure).
* Server-side ``?search=`` still matches against ``summary`` on the
  in-memory ``ConversationSummary`` BEFORE the list-item projection runs,
  so search queries that target the summary body keep working.
* ``ConversationListItem`` is a strict subset of ``ConversationSummary``
  (property test: every field on the skinny model also lives on the
  fuller one).
* The serialized payload is meaningfully smaller than the full shape
  (regression guard against accidentally restoring the dropped fields).

See PLANS/SPLIT_CONVERSATION_SCHEMA.md "TDD test plan" for the full
specification this file is implementing.
