"""Task A4 — PDF export must offload WeasyPrint render to a thread with a
30s timeout, returning 504 on overrun.

Two contracts:

1. **Concurrency**: an in-flight ``/api/.../export/pdf`` request must not
   block other event-loop traffic. Today the route calls
   ``create_pdf(...)`` synchronously inside ``async def export_pdf``,
   which pins the event loop for the entire WeasyPrint render (2-10s on
   long conversations). After the fix, the render lives on a thread and
   sibling requests stay responsive.
2. **Timeout**: a render that exceeds ``PDF_RENDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``
   must return ``504 Gateway Timeout`` (not 500, not hang, not 200 with
   truncated output). The frontend (Task A5) surfaces this as a toast.

These tests monkeypatch ``backend.routers.export.create_pdf`` (the
router's local name binding from ``from ..export import create_pdf``) to
a controlled blocking sleep, so we don't need WeasyPrint native libs to
exercise the concurrency/timeout codepath. Real WeasyPrint render tests
live in ``test_export_pdf_images.py`` and ``test_export_no_tool_placeholder.py``
and auto-skip when the libs aren't loadable.

NOTE: this filename intentionally does NOT contain "pdf" as a separate
token in the way the conftest auto-skip checks for. Wait — it DOES
contain "pdf". The autouse skip fixture in conftest fires on any nodeid
containing ``pdf``. We monkeypatch ``create_pdf`` so WeasyPrint is never
imported by these tests, so the skip is a false positive for this file.
To stay aligned with the project convention, we check WeasyPrint
availability ourselves: if it's missing AND someone tries to run the
real PDF render codepath, that's a separate issue. Our tests don't
touch the real renderer.

    request must complete BEFORE the PDF render finishes.

    Pre-fix (synchronous call): the event loop is pinned during the
    blocking sleep, so the sibling request can't make progress until
    the PDF render returns. Both requests therefore finish at roughly
    the same wall-clock time (~2s after kickoff).
    Post-fix (``asyncio.to_thread``): the WeasyPrint render runs on a
    worker thread; the event loop services the sibling request
    immediately while the render proceeds.

    Test shape: fire both requests via ``asyncio.gather`` so they
    schedule concurrently, and assert the sibling completes
    measurably earlier than the PDF response. With a 2s blocking
    sleep, a 500ms gap is a robust signal: pre-fix the gap is near
    zero (both block until PDF returns); post-fix the gap is ~2s.
