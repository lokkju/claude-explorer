"""P1.3b — TOOL_PLACEHOLDER must be stripped from BOTH Markdown and PDF
backend exports.

Claude Desktop emits the literal string ``"This block is not supported on
your current device yet."`` as a placeholder where a tool call or
artifact existed in the original session but couldn't be serialized to
the export. The frontend viewer hides this string entirely (replaced
with a friendly badge — see `frontend/.../MarkdownRenderer.tsx`); the
backend export surfaces (Markdown + PDF) MUST do the same so the user
isn't shipping that string to colleagues.

The frontend's canonical algorithm
(``stripToolPlaceholderText`` in ``MarkdownRenderer.tsx``):

  - OUTSIDE a fenced code block: drop ALL occurrences anywhere on the
    line (line-anchored OR mid-paragraph). If the line was non-empty
    before but is whitespace-only after, drop the line entirely.
  - INSIDE a fenced code block: leave the placeholder intact (the
    viewer's `code` component renders the badge using that text).

For backend exports we don't have the badge surface, so we strip the
placeholder unconditionally — fenced or not — to guarantee the literal
string is never visible to the recipient. This is stricter than the
frontend, but the user's requirement is "must not contain the literal
placeholder."
