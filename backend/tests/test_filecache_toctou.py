"""S5 T2c (2026-05-20) — `FileCache.get_or_load + set` TOCTOU.

The bug shape:

  ``get_or_load`` calls ``loader(path)`` to read content, then ``self.set(path, data)``
  with no explicit mtime; ``set`` re-stats inside to capture the mtime.
  Between the loader-read and the set-stat, the on-disk file can be
  mutated. The cache then stores ``(old_content, new_mtime)`` — a stale
  payload labeled with a fresh mtime. Subsequent ``get`` calls see
  ``cached.mtime == on_disk.mtime`` and return the stale data as "fresh."

The fix (this test pins): apply check-read-check inside ``get_or_load``:
capture mtime BEFORE the load, re-stat AFTER, and skip the set on
mismatch (so the next ``get_or_load`` re-loads). ``_load_and_cache``
already captures mtime before load and writes through with the pre-
load mtime — applying the same shape to ``get_or_load`` closes the gap.

The threading.Barrier coordinates the test: the loader and a "mutator"
thread both wait at the barrier, ensuring the file is mutated DURING
the read window.
