"""Pin the contract that ``/api/search`` does not block the event loop.

Background (2026-05-22): the original handlers were ``async def`` but
called the synchronous ``search_conversations(...)`` inline. While a
search ran (warm ~140ms, cold ~13s), the asyncio event loop was
frozen — every other endpoint (and every other tab's search) waited.
The fix is to declare the route handlers as plain ``def`` so FastAPI
auto-routes them to its anyio threadpool.

Two complementary tests live here:

  * **Structural** — ``inspect.iscoroutinefunction(search) is False``.
    Catches a future contributor accidentally re-adding ``async``.

  * **Dynamic** — fire a deliberately-slow ``/api/search`` and a
    concurrent ``/api/health``; assert health resolves quickly while
    search is mid-flight. Pins the event-loop-non-blocking *behavior*,
    which the structural test alone can't catch (someone could re-add
    ``async def`` plus ``await asyncio.to_thread(...)`` and the
    structural test would pass; the dynamic test would still pass
    too — both forms are valid).

Why both: the structural test is the cheap-and-deterministic regression
guard; the dynamic test catches behavior regressions like ``def`` +
``time.sleep()`` inadvertently re-added to a path *inside*
``search_conversations`` itself (which would still block via the
threadpool only if pool exhausted, but it pins the broader
event-loop-yields-promptly invariant the user depends on).

    """GET ``/api/search`` MUST offload the sync search to a threadpool.

    Two acceptable shapes (both protect the event loop):

      1. ``def search(...)`` — FastAPI auto-routes sync handlers to its
         anyio threadpool. The 2026-05-22 Wave 1 fix used this shape.

      2. ``async def search(...)`` that wraps the sync
         ``search_conversations`` call in ``asyncio.to_thread(...)``.
         Wave 2 (2026-05-22) adopted this shape so the handler can
         ALSO race against ``request.is_disconnected()`` and bail out
         when the client cancels mid-search.

    What this test catches: an ``async def`` handler that calls sync
    ``search_conversations(...)`` INLINE — that would freeze the
    event loop for the warm-path ~140ms / cold-path ~13s of the
    search, blocking every other tab's search, every health check,
    every list/detail fetch.

    Detection: read the handler source. If it's async, REQUIRE it to
    contain `asyncio.to_thread`. If it's sync, any body is fine
    (FastAPI off-threads it automatically).

    """Concurrent ``/api/search`` requests MUST run in parallel, not serialize.

    This pins the user's "multiple frontend instances per backend"
    requirement: two browser tabs (or any two concurrent clients) must
    not block each other while searching.

    Methodology — discriminating signal:
      * Monkeypatch ``backend.routers.search.search_conversations`` to
        ``time.sleep(SLOW_SEARCH_SEC)``. This mimics the worst-case
        blocking shape of the real function (sync sqlite + regex work).
      * Fire THREE concurrent ``/api/search`` requests via
        ``asyncio.gather``.
      * Assert the total wall time is closer to a SINGLE slow-search
        (parallel) than to 3x slow-search (serialized).

    Why three concurrent (not "search + health"):
      A single search + a single health-check is NOT discriminating —
      the trivial health endpoint can return early via loop mechanics
      that don't actually prove the search isn't blocking. THREE
      concurrent same-handler hits is the cleanest probe: under
      blocking, wall time is 3× SLOW_SEARCH_SEC; under threadpool
      off-loading, wall time is ~1× SLOW_SEARCH_SEC (all three slept in
      parallel on separate threadpool slots).

    Timing budget (council decision, 2026-05-22):
      * SLOW_SEARCH_SEC = 1.0 — long enough to make the
        parallel/serial distinction obvious, short enough that the
        test runs in ~1s.
      * Pass threshold: total <= 2.0s (1× sleep + generous overhead).
      * Fail threshold (regression): total ~= 3.0s (serialized loop).

      Generous budget chosen to be flake-resistant on loaded CI: the
      gap between "parallel" (~1s) and "serial" (~3s) is 2 full
      seconds, so a 2.0s ceiling catches the regression but tolerates
      threadpool startup overhead on a hot runner.
