"""Council code-review B6 (2026-05-21) — OpenAPI completeness.

Portfolio-piece V1 invariant: every route in the public API must
expose enough metadata for /docs to render a meaningful entry.
Currently many routes omit ``summary=`` (FastAPI silently falls
back to the docstring first-line, which is often too long or
mid-sentence to look polished).

This module pins:

  * Every route has a non-empty ``summary``.
  * Every route documents at least the 200 (or 201/204) response
    content-type that a reader would expect.

Two endpoint families are intentionally exempt and listed in the
``OPENAPI_EXEMPT_PATHS`` allow-list:

  * SSE streaming endpoints (``/fetch/start``, ``/fetch/refresh``)
    where the response body is ``text/event-stream`` and the
    OpenAPI schema can't fully express it. They are still required
    to have a ``summary``.

The test is designed to fail-build: a new route added without a
``summary=`` MUST trigger a failure in CI.

    Auto-derived summaries are the portfolio-piece tell — they read
    as "lowercase_function name with underscores stripped" rather
    than as English sentences.

    Heuristic: the summary is auto-derived if all of these hold:
      * It is short (<= 4 words / 35 chars) — explicit summaries
        for portfolio-piece quality are sentences.
      * Every word in the summary appears at the start of the
        operation_id (which contains the handler name verbatim).

    Falsifiable: a short explicit summary like "List bookmarks" with
    handler `list_bookmarks` SHOULD be flagged as auto-derived. The
    fix is to write a sentence-cased explicit summary.
