"""V1 polish (2026-05-13, Fix 5) — plumbing-fragility canary.

`backend/store._parse_message` hand-forwards a known list of CC-only
flags from the raw dict into the Pydantic `Message` constructor. Earlier
we lost an hour debugging the `slash_command` field because that single
forward line was omitted. To prevent recurrence we centralized the field
list in the `_CC_ONLY_PASSTHROUGH_FIELDS` constant and use dict-
comprehension forwarding.

This test introspects the `Message` model and FAILS the moment anyone
adds a new field without updating the constant. That's the canary's
job: brittle on purpose so the next CC-only field can't silently fall
through the floor.

Bidirectional contract:
  * POSITIVE: every CC-only field on the Message model is in the
    passthrough constant.
  * NEGATIVE: every Desktop-compatible field on the model is NOT in
    the passthrough constant (would be a bug — Desktop fields are
    forwarded by name explicitly in _parse_message).
