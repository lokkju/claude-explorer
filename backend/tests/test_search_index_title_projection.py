"""Pin the title-projection table that fixes cold-search latency.

Cold-search profile (2026-05-23, real corpus 250K messages, 344 unique
titles, 2.5GB FTS5 file):

  Wall: 7.572s
  - title_match_snippets (LIKE on FTS5 messages.title): 6.265s (82.7%)
  - query_with_snippets:                                 1.294s
  - Python work:                                         0.017s

Root cause: ``LIKE '%X%'`` against an FTS5 virtual table forces a full
virtual-table scan. The title column is FTS5-indexed but MATCH only
sees token-aligned substrings (porter+unicode61); the LIKE was carrying
the sub-token contract ("edul" inside "scheduled") at a 250K-row cost.

Fix: maintain a tiny ``conversations`` projection table (one row per
conversation, 344 rows in the user's corpus) with the same fields the
title sweep returns. The LIKE scan is now microseconds.

These tests pin:
  1. EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN for title sweep targets ``conversations``, NOT
     the FTS5 ``messages`` virtual table. (Algorithmic-complexity proof,
     CI-stable per Gemini-3-Pro / GPT-5.2 council convergence: time-
     based budgets flake; plan-shape is deterministic.)
  2. ``upsert_conversation`` writes to BOTH the messages table AND
     the projection in a single transaction.
  3. ``delete_conversation`` and ``delete_by_path`` purge the
     projection row alongside the messages.
  4. Title sweep returns byte-identical conv_uuids before-and-after
     for the LIKE-substring contract (the substring semantics MUST
     survive — "edul" inside "scheduled" still finds the conversation).
  5. Schema migration from v9 (no conversations table) populates the
     projection from existing messages via GROUP BY — no expensive
     full FTS5 rebuild required.

    """Opening a v10 DB on the v11 code MUST take the DROP+rebuild path.

    Unlike v9→v10 (metadata-only delta — added the conversations
    projection without touching message bodies), v11 changes the BODY
    projection: it excludes /compact trigger rows that pre-v11 indexed
    the user's verbatim prompt text from ``<command-args>``. Pre-v11
    rows still carry those tokens in the FTS5 inverted index, which
    can ONLY be corrected by re-running ``_extract_searchable_text``
    over every message — i.e. a full rebuild. There is no shortcut.

    Contract pinned here:
      * the ``messages`` table is DROPPED (row count == 0 immediately
        after open; subsequent ``build_full_index`` calls would
        repopulate it from disk);
      * the ``schema_version`` row is stamped to the current
        ``SCHEMA_VERSION``;
      * the ``conversations`` projection table is recreated empty.

    If a future maintainer is tempted to "preserve messages across the
    v10→v11 bump" with another fast-migration shim, this test will fail
    — and that's correct, because the body content needs re-extraction.
