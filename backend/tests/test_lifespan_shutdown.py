"""Lifespan shutdown tests for Task B4: explicit background-task cancellation.

The FastAPI lifespan handler in ``backend/main.py`` spawns several background
tasks during startup (migration retry, CC watcher, image-warm scan, FTS5 index
build, summary-cache eager fill). On shutdown, every non-completed task must
be cancelled explicitly and awaited so the process exits cleanly without
debug-unfriendly hangs.

This module pins:

  1. ``test_shutdown_completes_under_500ms``: with the CC watcher disabled
     (its synchronous ``observer.join`` is tested separately), shutdown of all
     other in-flight background tasks completes in < 500 ms.

  2. ``test_shutdown_cancels_in_flight_tasks``: a background task that would
     otherwise sleep for 30 s is cancelled on lifespan exit and never raises
     ``CancelledError`` out of the lifespan context.

The CC watcher's clean shutdown (Observer.stop + join in a finally block,
joined via ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the event loop stays responsive) has its
own coverage in ``test_cc_watcher.py``; this file focuses on the
top-level lifespan contract.

See PLANS/2026.05.18-backend-architecture-cleanup.md task B4.

    guaranteed to be mid-flight when we exit the lifespan context. The
    explicit cancellation in the shutdown handler must abandon the

    elapsed time stays well under 500ms.

    Pre-refactor failure mode: if the shutdown handler awaits each task
    individually without bounded timeouts, OR if a task swallows
    CancelledError, the test sleeps the full 30 s and fails.

    asyncio.to_thread + cancel pattern as several other lifespan tasks
    (search_index_task, migration_task). If this one cancels in <500ms,
