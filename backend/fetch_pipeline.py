"""Fetch pipeline helpers — SSE encoding and retry-event draining.

Extracted from ``backend/routers/fetch.py`` (Council A2, 2026-05-21).

This module hosts the small, pure helpers used by the fetch router's
SSE generators. The router itself (and the bigger ``_fetch_phase_stream``,
``_capture_phase_stream``, ``refresh_pipeline_stream`` generators that
make heavy use of test-patched names like ``ClaudeFetcher``,
``load_credentials``, ``capture_credentials``, ``DEFAULT_*``) intentionally
stays in ``backend.routers.fetch`` so ``monkeypatch.setattr`` semantics
keep working — see the 60+ patches at ``backend.routers.fetch.<name>``
under ``backend/tests/``.

Only patch-safe helpers (no module-level test-patched name references
inside their bodies) live here:

  * ``_send_event``        — pure ``json.dumps`` wrapper
  * ``_is_session_expired_error`` — pure string check
  * ``_drain_retry_events``       — takes the fetcher as a parameter

If you find yourself wanting to add a helper that references
``ClaudeFetcher``, ``load_credentials``, ``capture_credentials``, or any
of the ``DEFAULT_*`` paths at the module level, KEEP IT in the router —
or first refactor the test suite away from the router-path patch idiom.

    a retry happening and the user seeing the message is bounded by the

    during retry is jarring, upgrade to a real-time queue.
