    """GZipMiddleware that bypasses compression for /api/conversations/<uuid>.

    Why: a 69 MB ConversationDetail payload (real user corpus, 16K
    messages) takes ~700 ms of synchronous gzip CPU per request on the
    asyncio event loop. While that compresses, EVERY other concurrent
    response is blocked from being sent — three parallel conversation
    fetches serialize at ~3 s instead of ~1 s, and small endpoints like
    /api/config / /api/orgs / /api/preferences all queue behind the
    big one. This produced the user-reported "10 s perceived load" on
    2026-05-23.

    Trade-off (per the 2026-05-23 council decision record): the
    conversation route's wire size goes from ~27 MB (gzipped) to
    ~69 MB (identity). On localhost transfer is ~50 ms either way; on
    a 50 Mbps remote link the bigger payload costs ~6 s extra. V1 is a
    local-only single-user tool, so the trade-off is acceptable.

    Why not solve it globally (off-loop gzip via threadpool):
      * The conversation route is THE pathological case. Other large
        payloads (export endpoints, search results) are ~10-100 KB and
        their gzip-on-loop cost is sub-perceptible.
      * Per-route bypass ships in <50 LOC; an off-loop wrapper around
        GZipMiddleware needs careful interaction with streaming
        responses (Starlette emits the body as chunked
        ``http.response.body`` messages and the gzip middleware
        compresses each chunk). That is a larger V2 refactor.

    Why exact match not prefix:
      * Sub-routes /tree, /export/markdown, /export/pdf return
        normal-sized payloads and benefit from gzip. The exact-match
        regex (``^/api/conversations/[^/]+$``) skips bypass for any
        path with an extra slash, preserving gzip for everything except
        the detail route itself.

        # near-identical cancel/await/swallow blocks. That worked but
        # had three concrete problems:
        #
        #   1. **No hard cap on shutdown latency.** A task that wedged
        #      its own ``await task`` (e.g. an unawaited cancellation
        #      that left a coroutine in a non-finalised state) would
        #      stall the lifespan exit indefinitely.
        #
        #   2. **The watcher's cooperative shutdown waited up to 2 s
        #      synchronously** on ``asyncio.wait_for(watcher_task,
        #      timeout=2.0)``. With watchdog's Observer threads
        #      sometimes taking the full 5 s to join, this could span
        #      the entire 2 s window even when a CancelledError-based
        #      cleanup would have been instant. The watcher's own
        #      try/finally cleanup
        #      (:func:`backend.cc_watcher.run_watcher`) handles
        #      ``CancelledError`` correctly and offloads blocking
        #      Observer joins to ``asyncio.to_thread`` — so a hard
        #      cancel here returns immediately while the OS threads
        #      finish on their own (Python's ``threading._shutdown``
        #      waits for them at process exit if necessary).
        #
        #   3. **Exception diagnostics varied by task.**
        #      ``gather(*, return_exceptions=True)`` collects per-task
        #      results uniformly so we can log non-cancellation
        #      exceptions explicitly while expected CancelledErrors
        #      are silently absorbed.
        #
        # The 5-second total budget is a diagnostic cap: every task
        # we spawn is trivially cancellable (``asyncio.to_thread``
        # abandons its future instantly; the watcher has its own

    """Install a single-line per-request timing log.

    Emits ONE INFO log per response with the request method, path, status
    code, and elapsed wall time. Replaces uvicorn's default access log
    (which lacks elapsed time); when `claude-explorer serve` boots
    uvicorn, it passes `access_log=False` to avoid duplicate lines.

    Line format::

        GET /api/search?q=foo 200 elapsed=0.234s

    Routes the log through the ``uvicorn.error`` logger (NOT
    ``uvicorn.access`` — that logger's handler is removed by
    `--no-access-log`, and NOT a module-private logger like
    ``backend.main`` either — that one isn't wired to a handler by
    uvicorn's default LOGGING_CONFIG, so its INFO records get dropped
    silently by the root logger's WARNING-level handler). Routing
    through ``uvicorn.error`` means the line appears in the same
    stream as startup messages and stays visible regardless of the
    `--no-access-log` flag. The 2026-05-22 bug it fixes: live
    backend was silent after `--no-access-log` because the
    ``backend.main`` logger had no handler attached.

    Wrapped in a separate function so the FastAPI test harness can
    install the middleware on a minimal app without re-importing the
    full router stack — see `backend/tests/test_request_timing_log.py`.

    Why a custom middleware vs uvicorn's `--log-config`: keeping the
    timing logic in-tree means it survives any deploy config (Docker,
    systemd, ad-hoc `uvicorn` from a shell) and is unit-testable.

    Implementation: PURE ASGI middleware, NOT the BaseHTTPMiddleware-
    based ``@app.middleware("http")`` decorator. The decorator form
    buffers the response body internally, which makes every response
    look like a streaming response (``more_body=True`` on the first
    chunk) to downstream middleware. That broke ``GZipMiddleware``'s
    ``minimum_size=1024`` small-skip optimization on 2026-05-23 — every
    tiny /api/health / /api/info response was being gzipped and shipping
    a Content-Encoding: gzip header. The pure-ASGI form below preserves
    the ``more_body`` flag end-to-end so GZip's small-skip works as
    designed. Pinned by ``test_small_response_is_not_gzipped``.

# GZip compression for large API responses (2026-05-23 user-report fix).
#
# The user's 16K-message ConversationDetail payload is ~69 MB
# uncompressed. Gzip-1 reduces this to ~28 MB (60% reduction) at ~50 ms
# of CPU cost on a Mac M-series — far less than the 11+ seconds saved
# on a typical broadband network. Browsers always send
# ``Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br`` and transparently decode the
# response, so no frontend change is needed.
#
# Trade-off (documented per 2026-05-23 council review): compression runs
# on the asyncio event loop. ``compresslevel=1`` keeps the worst-case
# block at ~50 ms even on the 69 MB payload, acceptable for a
# single-user localhost tool. If Claude Explorer ever becomes
# multi-tenant or LAN-shared, move compression to a reverse proxy
# (nginx / caddy) or wrap compression in ``asyncio.to_thread`` — same
# pattern as the ``/api/search`` threadpool fix (commit 7623c12).
#
# ``minimum_size=1024`` (Starlette default-ish, industry-standard):
# below ~1 KB, gzip's framing overhead can produce a LARGER output and
# always wastes CPU. Pinned by ``test_small_response_is_not_gzipped``.
#
# Middleware order: ``add_middleware`` prepends to the response chain,
# so the LAST middleware added runs FIRST on the request. Currently:
#   request:  timing -> CORS -> gzip -> route
#   response: route -> gzip -> CORS -> timing
# This means the request-timing middleware measures pre-gzip wall time
# (the route's actual work), NOT compression time. That keeps the
# elapsed=Xs log meaningful for backend perf diagnosis.
