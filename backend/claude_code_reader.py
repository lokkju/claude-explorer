"""
Read Claude Code conversations directly from local JSONL files.

Claude Code (CLI and Desktop Code tab) stores conversations locally at:
    ~/.claude/projects/{project-path-encoded}/{session-uuid}.jsonl

This module reads those JSONL files on-the-fly without copying them.
Features:
- orjson for fast JSON parsing (3-10x faster than stdlib)
- Memory cache with mtime-based invalidation
- Parallel file reading with ThreadPoolExecutor

    """Run :func:`read_conversation_summary_fast` across paths concurrently.

    Returns a dict keyed by the input ``Path``; the value is either the
    metadata dict the fast reader returned, or ``None`` for files that
    were empty / unreadable (the caller should skip those rather than
    cache them).

    Concurrency strategy (empirically tuned, NOT the original
    "threads + GIL-releasing orjson" plan):

      * 0 paths → empty dict (no pool spinup).
      * 1 to ``_PROCESS_POOL_THRESHOLD`` paths → sequential. ProcessPool
        spawn overhead (~150ms on macOS) dominates over the work below
        this threshold.
      * Above the threshold → ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` with 8 workers.
        The pure-Python ``for line in f / entry.get(...)`` cycle inside
        ``read_conversation_summary_fast`` is GIL-bound (orjson.loads
        is only ~46% of cumulative time per a cProfile run), so
        threads actually run SLOWER than sequential on 970 files
        (8.94s vs 5.62s) due to GIL contention. Processes sidestep
        the GIL entirely (970 files in 1.81s, ~3x faster than
        sequential, ~5x faster than threads).
      * Process-pool failure (sandboxed Python, fork restrictions,
        ImportError on the child side, etc.) → fall back to a
        ThreadPoolExecutor pass. Worst case the cold-install
        benchmark gets slow; warm-path latency is unaffected because
