"""
High-performance caching for Claude Code conversation files.

This module provides:
1. Memory cache with mtime-based invalidation
2. Parallel file reading with ThreadPoolExecutor
3. Fast JSON parsing with orjson
4. Optional LRU eviction cap (``max_entries``) to bound memory growth
   on long-running servers (see PLANS/PERFORMANCE_PHASE_2.md §C1 R8).

Backend caches at a glance (Cache landscape, 2026-05-18):
  * ``FileCache`` (this module) — in-memory, per-path mtime-keyed cache
    of parsed conversation dicts; LRU-bounded; lost on process restart.
  * ``SummaryCache`` (``backend/summary_cache.py``) — SQLite-persisted
    sidebar summaries; mtime+size invalidation per row; full table wipe
    on ``claude_code_reader.LOGIC_VERSION`` mismatch at lifespan startup.
  * ``SearchIndex`` (``backend/search_index.py``) — SQLite FTS5 inverted
    index; drift-first incremental rebuild keyed on ``indexed_files``
    mtime; full drop+rebuild on ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` bump or column-set
    drift in the ``messages`` virtual table.

class CacheEntry:
    """A cached file entry with its modification time."""
    mtime: float
    data: Any


class FileCache:
    """Thread-safe file cache with mtime-based invalidation.

    When ``max_entries`` is set to a positive integer, the cache evicts
    the least-recently-used entry on insert past the cap. ``get`` hits
    promote the entry to most-recently-used so a hot conversation
    survives bursts of fresh reads.

    When ``max_entries`` is ``None`` (the default), the cache grows
    without bound — preserves the historical behavior for tests and
    call sites that haven't opted in to a cap.

    Threading: an ``RLock`` guards both the backing ``OrderedDict``
    and the LRU bookkeeping. ``get`` takes the lock to record the
    use, so concurrent readers serialize briefly. Acceptable for our
    workload (file I/O dominates).

    Invalidation policy:
      * **Trigger**: every ``get`` re-stats the file and returns
        ``(data, False)`` when the on-disk mtime no longer matches the
        cached entry; an ``OSError`` (file gone) yields the same
        ``(None, False)`` signal but the stale ``CacheEntry`` stays
        resident until a subsequent ``set``, ``invalidate``, ``clear``,
        or LRU eviction overwrites it. The caller treats a non-fresh
        hit as "reload via ``set``", which re-promotes to MRU. Explicit
        ``invalidate(path)`` and ``clear()`` are available for
        orchestrated purges.
      * **Persists across restart**: nothing — the cache is purely
        in-memory; restart is a cold cache.
      * **Full rebuild**: not applicable; entries are re-populated
        lazily on demand. ``clear()`` (or process restart) achieves the
        same effect.
      * **Failure mode**: there's no "fallback" — a ``stat()`` failure
        returns ``(None, False)`` and callers re-load from disk via
        the supplied loader. A loader exception inside
        ``load_many_parallel`` logs and stores ``None`` for that slot;
        ``MemoryError`` propagates so OOM stays visible.

# ``max_entries=4096`` caps in-memory growth at ~4k parsed conversation
# dicts. The cap exists to bound long-running server memory (defending
# against the R8 risk in PLANS/PERFORMANCE_PHASE_2.md §C1), NOT to
# trim the working set — search and sidebar paths call
# ``store.get_all_conversations_raw`` which warms every conversation
# in the corpus on first call. A tight cap (e.g. 64) would thrash
# under that path: the corpus walk warms N entries, evicts down to
# the cap, and the FTS5 scatter-gather then has to re-load most of
# them.
#
# Sizing: the heaviest known CC corpus today is ~1k conversations;
# 4x headroom (~4k) protects us against organic growth while still
# bounding pathological cases (e.g. a test or script that creates
# millions of conversations).
#
# Rationale for the value (PLANS/PERFORMANCE_PHASE_2.md §C1 R8):
#   * Typical CC session: <5 MB parsed in memory.
#   * 4,096 typical entries: ~20 GB resident in the worst case where
#     every entry is "typical". In practice corpora are mixed; mean
#     resident on the user's heavy 991-conv corpus is ~1-2 GB.
#   * Heavy sessions (288 MB on disk) are rare; the LRU keeps the
#     hot N in cache where N ≪ 4096.
#
# A future refinement could weight by serialized size and cap on
# memory bytes rather than entry count. Out of scope for V1.
