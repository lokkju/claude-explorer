"""``/api/orgs`` endpoint — workspace selector source.

cowork-multi-org C6 / Council P1-2 + NEW-P0-C: the sidebar's workspace
selector reads from credentials.json (always known *before* any conversation
is fetched) rather than from ``useConversations({}).data`` (which would force
a 5-10k row reduction every render and flip set membership during streaming
SSE fetches).

Three-state response:

* ``200 {authenticated: true, orgs: [...]}`` — creds present + parseable.
* ``200 {authenticated: false, orgs: []}`` — creds file absent. Returns 200
  rather than 404 so the frontend's global ApiError toast doesn't fire.
* ``503 {detail: "<string>"}`` — creds present but unreadable; the user
  needs to wipe and recapture.

Council code-review B+D batch (2026-05-21) unified the corrupt branch
with ``files.py``'s response for the same condition. Pre-council the
shape was ``500 {detail: {error: "credentials_corrupt", message: ...}}``
— the ONLY HTTPException site in the backend with a dict-shaped
``detail``. Forty other sites use string ``detail``. The FE
``getOrgs`` / ``useOrgs`` consumer never read ``detail.error`` (it
just throws ``ApiError(status, response.text())``), so the
unification is a wire-shape tightening with no known caller
breakage. See ``backend/tests/test_orgs.py`` for the regression
suite that pins the new contract.
