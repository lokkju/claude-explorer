"""Search router.

Two transports supported (2026-05-14, sidebar-scope propagation):

  * **GET /api/search?...** — existing query-string contract. All scope
    knobs accepted as query params. CSV (``conversation_uuids=a,b,c``)
    is supported but kept for small scopes; large active-filter sets
    blow past h11 / proxy URL-length limits.

  * **POST /api/search** — new variant. Same scope knobs in a JSON body.
    The frontend defaults to POST when it has a ``conversation_uuids``
    list to send; this avoids 414/431 at proxies and dodges SQLite's
    ``SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER`` (often 999) on the underlying
    ``IN (...)`` clauses.

Both methods delegate to :func:`backend.search.search_conversations` with
identical kwargs — only the transport differs.
