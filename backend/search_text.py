"""Pure text-projection helpers shared by ``backend.search`` and
``backend.search_index``.

This module is a stdlib-only leaf — it imports nothing from the rest of the
``backend`` package. It exists to break the import cycle between
``backend.search`` and ``backend.search_index``: pre-cycle, ``search_index``
imported ``_extract_searchable_text`` from ``search`` at module load while
``search`` imported ``get_search_index`` from ``search_index`` (lazily, but
the structural defect remained). Extracting the three projection helpers
here makes ``search_index`` depend on this leaf only, and ``search`` may
keep its lazy import of ``search_index`` for the orthogonal reasons
documented at the call site (test patchability + ``ImportError``
fallback tolerance).

Public surface for the rest of the codebase is preserved: ``backend.search``
re-exports all three symbols, so existing test imports
(``from backend.search import _extract_searchable_text``) keep working
byte-for-byte.

# /compact trigger-row envelope (2026-05-23). When the user runs a manual
# ``/compact``, Claude Code emits TWO related JSONL rows: the synthetic
# ``isCompactSummary: true`` summary message (rendered by the frontend as
# the compact-marker pill), AND a SECOND user row carrying the replayed
# slash-command envelope (``<command-name>/compact</command-name>`` plus
# the user's verbatim prompt inside ``<command-args>``). The second row is
# CHROME — the marker pill is the user-facing surface. Indexing the
# trigger row's body produces search hits on the user's own prompt text
# that land on the WRONG message_uuid (the trigger row's, not the
# marker's), defeating the frontend's compact-marker auto-expand chain
# (which keys on ``compact_marker.message_uuid``).
#
# Constant equivalence: this literal MUST match ``_COMPACT_COMMAND_NAME``
# in :mod:`backend.cc_image_markers` (the existing extract_compact_markers
# pass uses the same literal for lookahead classification). Defined here
# (not imported from cc_image_markers) to preserve the stdlib-only-leaf
# layering invariant documented in this module's docstring. A behavioral
# coupling test in test_search_compact_trigger_rewrite.py pins the offset
# semantics in lockstep so the two constants cannot silently drift.

def _is_compact_trigger_message(message: dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """True iff this message is the user-typed ``/compact`` trigger row.

    A manual /compact produces THREE related artifacts in CC JSONL:

      1. ``isCompactSummary: True`` synthetic user message — the LLM's
         compaction summary. The frontend's auto-expand chain keys on
         this row's UUID. This row IS searchable (its summary body is
         useful content; users should be able to navigate to it).
      2. THE TRIGGER ROW: a regular user message with text wrapping the
         ``<command-name>/compact</command-name>`` envelope plus
         ``<command-args>{user_prompt_verbatim}</command-args>``. This
         row is chrome — the runtime's replay of what the user typed.
         The marker (#1) is the user-facing surface; the trigger has
         no UI of its own.
      3. The user's typed prose, which lives ONLY inside the trigger
         row's ``<command-args>`` block (no other JSONL row carries
         that text).

    This predicate identifies #2 so the indexer and the linear-scan
    fallback can skip its body. A search for words the user typed in
    their own compact prompt would otherwise land on the trigger row's
    UUID, and the frontend's compact-marker auto-expand would not fire
    (it keys on the marker UUID, not the trigger).

    Detection rule: the message must be a USER message AND carry the
    literal ``<command-name>/compact</command-name>`` envelope somewhere
    in its text payload. The sender guard prevents accidental
    suppression of an assistant that quotes the envelope (e.g. in a
    debugging transcript). The literal-substring check is exactly the
    same rule :func:`backend.cc_image_markers.extract_compact_markers`
    uses to classify a marker as ``manual`` (it scans forward looking
    for the same string within an 8-message lookahead window), so the
    two passes cannot drift on what counts as a trigger row.

    Both message surfaces are checked: ``message["text"]`` (the flat
    string set by ``store._parse_message``) AND every text-type content
    block. CC sometimes emits the envelope as a single text block
    instead of a flat string (see
    test_extract_compact_markers_list_content_blocks in
    backend/tests/test_compact_markers.py), so both surfaces matter.

    Defensive against missing keys / None values: ``message.get("text")``
    returns None on missing key; the ``or ""`` coerces None to a safe
    empty string before the substring check. Consulted from the hot
    indexing path AND the scatter-gather rewrite — any TypeError would
    crash search.

    """Flatten every searchable surface of a message into one string.

    Covers: message['text'] (Desktop API plain text), and all content blocks —
    text, tool_use input dicts (Bash command, file paths, prompt args), and
    tool_result content (which can be a string OR a list of text blocks).

    When ``include_tool_calls=False``:
      * Skips ``tool_use`` and ``tool_result`` content blocks.
      * Strips the Desktop "This block is not supported…" placeholder from
        ``message['text']`` (mirrors frontend ``messageHasVisibleContent``
        and ``filterToolPlaceholders``). A message whose ``text`` field is
        only that placeholder yields the empty string here.
      * ``text``-type blocks are unchanged — they ARE the user-visible body.

    ``thinking`` blocks are NEVER indexed regardless of the toggle
    (V1 polish 2026-05-13): the frontend has no `case 'thinking':`
    renderer in V1, so indexing thinking content produces search
    "ghosts" — a query that hits inside a thinking block returns a
    result whose bubble shows nothing matching. Until a `Show thinking`
    UI affordance ships, hide it from search too. Spec invariant: search
    only returns hits the user can navigate to. The accompanying
    `backend/search_index.SCHEMA_VERSION` bump (2 → 3) forces a one-time
    rebuild so stale thinking-only matches don't pollute the FTS5
    top-N ranking.

    Default ``include_tool_calls=True`` preserves prior indexing behavior
    for tool blocks; the FTS5 index ALWAYS uses the full projection so
    the index stays correct regardless of the per-query filter (the
    filter is applied at snippet/scatter time, not at index time — see
    search.py module docstring on the "include_tool_calls" architecture).

    Argless command-marker exclusion (V1 polish 2026-05-13):
    Argless slash markers (``is_command_marker=True``: ``/exit``, ``/clear``,
    ``/compact`` and the leading-prelude rows that ``_flag_leading_prelude_markers``
    flags on top of them) are CHROME, not user content. The viewer hides them
    behind ``SessionPreludeAffordance`` / ``SlashCommandBadge`` and the export
    surfaces drop them via ``export._is_excludable_marker``. The search
    projection mirrors that exclusion here — typing ``exit`` in the search
    box should NOT produce hits on ``Session: /exit`` chrome rows.

    Predicate equivalence with ``export._is_excludable_marker`` (export.py:159)
    is INTENTIONAL: both surfaces apply the same definition of "chrome" so the
    spec invariant "one truth, three surfaces" (viewer + search + export) holds.
    Argful markers (``/coding <prose>``, ``/plan <prose>``) carry
    ``is_command_marker=False`` post-Fix-2 (claude_code_reader 2026-05-13), so
    they pass through this guard and remain searchable on the user's real
    prose body AND on the ``slash_command`` token.

    Strict ``is True`` check (not truthy): defends against non-bool injections
    (e.g. ``"false"`` string, ``1`` int) from fixtures or future code paths that
    might silently exclude legitimate messages. Production data is always bool
    per the Pydantic ``Message`` model (models.py) and the CC ingester
    (claude_code_reader.py:342 sets it as a real boolean), but the function
    signature is ``dict[str, Any]`` so we don't trust truthiness.

    Index-time side effect (paired with SCHEMA_VERSION bump 3 → 4 in
    search_index.py): ``upsert_conversation`` writes ``body=""`` for these
    rows, so they contribute no tokens to the FTS5 inverted index. Title is
    still populated, so unqualified MATCH on a conversation title is still
    correct — the title pseudo-message comes from the `_search_via_index`
    title-sweep, not from marker-row body matches.

      * **Keys axis** — every dict key reachable (top-level and nested)
        is emitted once, space-joined into a single line. A user query
        like ``command`` or ``file_path`` hits this line via the FTS5
        unicode61 tokenizer.
      * **Values axis** — every unique string value at any depth is
        emitted on its own line. A user query like ``echo hello`` hits
        a value line directly.

    Pre-v9 implementation used ``json.dumps(tool_input)`` (which already
