"""Permanent cache for Claude Code image-cache attachments (P4a).

Claude Code stores image attachments at
``~/.claude/image-cache/<sess>/<N>.<ext>`` and references them inside
message text as a literal ``[Image: source: <abs-path>]`` marker.
Claude Code rotates / deletes those files; the explorer's viewer then
breaks. To keep them around forever, at fetch time we copy each
referenced file into:

    ``<data_dir>/cc-images/<conv-uuid>/<sess>--<N>.<sha8>.<ext>``

The ``sha8`` suffix prevents collisions if a re-fetch produces
different bytes for the same ``<sess>--<N>`` slot. We do **not** delete
old copies — both survive on disk; the fallback endpoint (P4b) resolves
the conversation marker to the most recent.
