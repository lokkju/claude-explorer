"""Message-pipeline transforms for Claude Code JSONL conversations.

This module owns the stateless, in-memory transforms that turn a raw
list of JSONL entries (already parsed into dicts by
:mod:`backend.cc_jsonl_io`) into the final ``chat_messages`` list that
the frontend renders. None of these functions touch the filesystem.

Layering:
  * Pure leaf module — depends only on ``re``, ``datetime``, and
    standard-library bits.
  * Imported by ``backend.cc_jsonl_io`` (for ``_is_system_message`` +
    ``_extract_title_from_message`` + ``_get_message_text`` used by the
    fast metadata reader), by ``backend.cc_image_markers`` (for
    ``_get_message_text``), and by the facade module
    ``backend.claude_code_reader`` (for the full transform pipeline
    inside ``read_claude_code_conversation``).

Pipeline order (as orchestrated by the facade):
  1. ``_merge_entries_to_message`` — fold CC's streaming-chunk entries
     into one message per logical turn.
  2. ``_collapse_local_command_triplets`` — replace
     <local-command-caveat>/<command-name>/<local-command-stdout>
     runs with a single synthetic marker.
  3. ``_fold_canned_assistant_responses_into_marker`` — absorb CC's
     canned ``"No response requested."`` assistant rows into the
     preceding marker.
  4. ``_flag_leading_prelude_markers`` — flag the leading run of argless
     markers with ``is_prelude: True``.

Title helpers (``_title_from_entry``, ``_extract_title_from_message``)
and the system-message classifier (``_is_system_message``) live here
because they are pure text-classification helpers operating on
already-parsed dicts.

# Local-command boilerplate collapse (V1 polish, 2026-05-12):
# Claude Code emits a 1-3 row triplet around every slash command:
#   1. <local-command-caveat>Caveat: ...</local-command-caveat>
#   2. <command-name>/foo</command-name><command-args>...</command-args>
#   3. <local-command-stdout>...</local-command-stdout>
# Rows 1 and 3 are pure boilerplate. Row 2 carries the actual command.
# Raw, these dominate the top of any session that started with /exit or /clear.
# We collapse the consecutive run into a single synthetic marker on the FIRST
# row's slot (keeping its uuid for parent_message_uuid bridging) and drop the
# rest. /compact is handled separately by `extract_compact_markers` — we skip
# it here so the two systems don't fight.
#
# Args-preservation extension (V1 polish round 3, 2026-05-12):
# Slash commands like /coding, /plan, /compact, /metaprompt carry the
# USER'S REAL PROMPT inside <command-args>...</command-args>. The original
# collapser threw those args away, leaving an empty "Session: /coding"
# marker bubble — silent data loss of the user's actual message text.
# We now ALSO extract the args body and use it as the marker's `text`
# when non-empty (fallback to "Session: /foo" only when args is empty
# or absent). A separate `slash_command` field carries the command name
# so the frontend can render a small `[/coding]` badge above the body.
#
# REGEX CHOICES:
#   * `_LOCAL_CMD_NAME_RE`: unchanged — name is a non-whitespace, non-`<`
#     token following `<command-name>`. The leading `/` is required.
#   * `_LOCAL_CMD_ARGS_RE`: non-greedy body anchored to a domain-specific
#     trailing-context lookahead. Reads as:
#         <command-args>(.*?)</command-args>(?=\s*(?:<command-name>|$))
#     i.e. capture the shortest body that ends at a `</command-args>`
#     CLOSE TAG which is followed by either (a) the start of the NEXT
#     command triplet `<command-name>`, or (b) end-of-row. This:
#       1) Bug 1 (V1 polish, 2026-05-14): tolerates a literal
#          `<command-name>` SUBSTRING inside the args body (e.g. the user
#          pastes a prompt explaining CC's XML format). The previous
#          tempered-greedy regex `((?:(?!<command-name>).)*)` forbade
#          this and returned None, silently dropping the user's prompt
#          and falling back to the argless marker label.
#       2) Preserves the original user-paste tolerance: a literal
#          `</command-args>` inside the args body is NOT a valid match
#          terminator unless what follows it is `\s*<command-name>` or
#          end-of-row — so a body of `Explain </command-args> means...`
#          inside a wrapper still anchors at the REAL wrapper close at
#          end-of-row.
#       3) Bounds multi-block rows correctly: in a row with two glued
#          triplets `...</command-args><command-name>...</command-name>
#          <command-args>...`, the lookahead matches at the FIRST close
#          (next char is `<command-name>`), so the args body correctly
#          stops at the first block — no over-match across blocks.
#       4) Why anchor on `<command-name>` specifically and not a generic
#          `<|$`? GPT-5.2 (LLM council, 2026-05-14) flagged that a
#          permissive `<|$` lookahead would mis-terminate when the args
#          body itself ends with a literal `</command-args>` immediately
#          before the real wrapper close (`...</command-args></command-args>`
#          shape) — the next char is `<` but it's the wrapper close, not
#          a new triplet. Tying the lookahead to the actual sentinel
#          (`<command-name>`) keeps the parser pinned to the real
#          structural boundary CC emits and avoids that whole class of
#          truncation bugs.
#     Performance: classic non-greedy `(.*?)` plus a fixed-length
#     lookahead. No nested quantifiers ⇒ no catastrophic-backtracking
#     shape. Worst case is O(n·k) where k is the number of candidate
#     close tags that fail the lookahead — fine for typical args bodies
#     of 100–1000 chars.

        a valid pointer — this is the "bridge" Gemini-3-Pro flagged in the

        `"Session: Local command"` if no <command-name> row was found in the

        (italic / smaller / etc.) — but the field is optional; if the
        frontend ignores it the bubble just renders as a short user message.
      * Skips runs that look like /compact — those are owned by the existing
        `extract_compact_markers` system and have their own UI affordance.

    Bidirectional guarantees:
      * A session with `[caveat, command(/exit), stdout, real_user, assistant]`

#   * Fold matches ONLY the exact (post-`.strip()`) string. A future CC

#     real history we MUST NOT drop.
#   * Both passes are pure-functional: shallow-copy `out` list, shallow-copy
#     only the dicts we modify. Input list and its member dicts are never
#     mutated. Callers can safely reuse the original list.
#   * Both passes are idempotent: a second run of the fold finds no
#     marker→canned-assistant pair (the assistant is gone); a second run of
#     the flag finds the same prefix and sets the same flags.
#
# Why a SEPARATE pass instead of folding into `_collapse_local_command_triplets`?

    """Flag the leading run of ARGLESS `is_command_marker` messages with
    `is_prelude: True`. Returns `(new_list, prelude_hidden_count)`.

    Stops at the FIRST message that is either:
      * NOT a command marker (real user/assistant turn or /compact summary
        the triplet-collapser passed through), OR
      * an ARGFUL command marker — i.e. a /coding/ /plan/ /metaprompt/etc
        marker whose `text` carries the user's REAL prompt body. Hiding
        those behind the prelude affordance would silently bury real user
        content; the whole point of args preservation is to surface it.

    ARGLESS/ARGFUL DETECTION
    ------------------------
    We read the PRIVATE `_argless_marker` flag set by
    `_collapse_local_command_triplets` at marker-construction time. The
    flag is the source of truth and resistant to user-injected
    "Session: /foo" args text. Three cases:

      * `_argless_marker is True`  → argless; FLAG as prelude.
      * `_argless_marker is False` → argful; BREAK the prelude run.
      * Key absent                 → legacy fixture path. Fall back to
        the pre-args-preservation behavior: any leading command marker
        is prelude. This keeps pre-existing tests that synthesize
        markers WITHOUT the flag (e.g.
        `test_canned_response_fold_and_prelude.py::_marker`) working.
        REAL markers produced by the collapser always have the flag,
        so this fallback never fires on production data.

    Pure-functional: shallow-copies only the flagged dicts; non-flagged
    entries are reference-equal in the output. The `_argless_marker`
    key remains on the dict but is stripped at serialization time by
    Pydantic v2's default `extra='ignore'` (the `Message` model never
    declares it).
