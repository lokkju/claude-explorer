/**
 * Distance-gated, layout-shift-resilient scroll-into-view for message
 * bubbles. Used by the search-hit fast path
 * (`navigateToMatch.ts`) and the URL-highlight effect
 * (`ConversationPage.tsx`).
 *
 * Bug background (2026-05-20, 3-model LLM council):
 *   Native `scrollIntoView({behavior:'smooth', block:'center'})` aims
 *   at the target's `offsetTop` AT CALL TIME and animates over ~500ms.
 *   During the animation, lazy-loaded images
 *   (`<img loading="lazy">`, no intrinsic dimensions) above the target
 *   enter the swept region, decode, and grow from ~0px up to 384px
 *   each (`max-h-96` in MessageBubble.tsx). On a 15K-msg conversation,
 *   `scrollHeight` grew by 16,109 px during one observed animation,
 *   landing the target 4,000–5,300 px BELOW viewport center. Smooth
 *   scrollIntoView does NOT re-aim mid-flight.
 *
 * Strategy — distance-gated two-mode:
 *   - **Long hop** (target > 1.5 viewports from container center):
 *     scroll instantly with `behavior: 'auto'`. The intermediate
 *     lazy-image region is never swept, so it never inflates the
 *     document. The motion cue is informational noise for a 16K-px
 *     jump anyway (just blurs).
 *   - **Short hop** (≤ 1.5 viewports): keep `behavior: 'smooth'` for
 *     the motion cue. Drift is small because few unmounted images are
 *     swept.
 *
 *   Then a **bounded multi-shot** post-settle correction at 250ms,
 *   750ms, and 1250ms. Any image with `decoding="async"` that lands
 *   in viewport after the scroll can push the target by up to ~384 px
 *   over the next few layout passes. The first 250ms tick covers the
 *   common case (single image cascade); the two later ticks catch the
 *   long-tail case (multi-image cascades on 15K+ message
 *   conversations where many lazy images decode sequentially). Each
 *   tick is conditional on drift > 100 px AND not superseded by a
 *   newer call; once drift settles within the threshold the chain
 *   stops early. Max 3 corrections — beyond that we stop yanking the
 *   user even if the page is still settling (they're trying to read).
 *
 * Concurrency — supersession token:
 *   Rapid Cmd+G hits (cycling through search matches) can queue
 *   multiple corrections. Without a token, hit-A's 250ms correction
 *   could fire AFTER hit-B's scroll, yanking the user back to hit A.
 *   `scrollToken` is a module-level monotonic counter; each call
 *   captures its token, and the correction no-ops if a newer call
 *   superseded it.
 *
 * Spec note — `behavior: 'auto'` vs `'instant'`:
 *   CSSOM-VIEW Level 1's `ScrollBehavior` enum is `'auto' | 'smooth'`.
 *   `'instant'` is a `scrollTo`-only value (Window/Element.scrollTo,
 *   Window/scrollBy) — TypeScript's `lib.dom.d.ts` rejects it for
 *   `scrollIntoView`. `'auto'` is the spec-correct way to request an
 *   instant scroll via scrollIntoView and is treated as instant in
 *   Chromium/Firefox/Safari when CSS `scroll-behavior` is unset (the
 *   default).
 *
 * Threshold note — 1.5 viewports:
 *   Empirical heuristic. Above ~1.5 viewports, the smooth-scroll
 *   motion provides no spatial context; below it, the motion cue is
 *   valuable and drift is bounded. WWCMM: smoke test on the 15K conv
 *   showing drift on hops <1.5 viewports → tighten threshold.
 *
 * Residual: this helper does NOT fix the root cause (images without
 * reserved dimensions). Layout shift will still occur AFTER landing
 * as the user scrolls further. Real fix is backend-provided image
 * dimensions + CSS `aspect-ratio`. Deferred — see follow-up issue.
