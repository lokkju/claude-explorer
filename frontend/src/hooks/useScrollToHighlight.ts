/**
 * useScrollToHighlight — multi-stage scroll-to-highlight orchestration.
 *
 * Extracted from ConversationPage.tsx (2026-05-30, P1.4 Commit B from
 * PLANS/2026.05.30-STRICT-CODE-QUALITY-REVIEW.md) verbatim — every line
 * of behavior is preserved. The hook owns the 5-stage pipeline that
 * fires whenever `highlightMessageId` flips:
 *
 *   1. setFocusArea('detail') + setSelectedMessageIndex(matchIdx)
 *   2. virtualizer.scrollToIndex(visIdx, { align: 'center' }) to mount
 *      the target row (post-virt: rows aren't mounted until requested).
 *   3. rAF-poll up to ~600 ms for the bubble's DOM node to appear.
 *   4. scrollBubbleIntoView (lazy-image-aware post-settle correction),
 *      ring-flash, focus (if shouldFocusOnHighlight), 2 s scheduled
 *      URL-cleanup that ALSO race-guards against newer navigations.
 *   5. cleanup on re-fire / unmount cancels the rAF chain.
 *
 * All deps are passed in — the hook reaches into no context internally
 * so unit tests can drive it directly. See useBracketCompactNav for the
 * lighter sibling extraction.
 *
 * 2026-05-23 virtualization landing: target bubbles deep in the
 * conversation (e.g. idx 550/600 of the search-hit-scroll fixture) are
 * NOT mounted on initial page load. Pre-virt, all bubbles were mounted
 * eagerly, so a 100 ms setTimeout was enough for React to commit and
 * `querySelector` to find them. Post-virt, the target exists only as
 * virtualizer state until we tell it to bring the row into view.
 *
 * Why polling instead of a component mount-effect (Option A "pure" from
 * the council): the cleanup callback (URL `setSearchParams`) belongs to
 * the parent's URL state, and the highlight target may be either
 * MessageBubble OR CompactMarker — threading symmetric props + cleanup
 * callbacks through both component types is broader-diff than the
 * polling approach with no functional benefit. The polling window is
 * bounded (600 ms ≪ the 2 s ring-flash duration) and only runs when
 * `highlightMessageId` is truthy (Cmd+G hits and deep-link navigation;
 * not the typing hot path).

    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps -- scheduleHighlightClear is the return value of useUnmountSafeTimer(), which is a fresh closure each render (no useCallback). Including it would re-fire this whole highlight/scroll/focus effect on every render while highlightMessageId is truthy, causing repeated scrollBubbleIntoView calls + URL mutations. The timer callback closes over `element` (DOM ref) and `setSearchParams` (already a dep); the schedule call itself is fire-and-forget. Same pattern as FilterContext.tsx:291, ManageFiltersModal.tsx:603, SearchPanel.tsx:109.
